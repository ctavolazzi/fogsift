# Work Effort: Hotline Button Clarity

## Status: Completed
**Started:** 2025-12-26 18:14
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-27 (updated CTA text)

## Objective
Improve the "Weird Question Hotline" button to make it clearer that:
1. Clicking it sends an email to christopher@fogsift.com
2. The "under an hour" response time starts when Christopher sees the message (not when sent)
3. Updated: Removed time promise, replaced with more exciting and enticing value-focused copy

## Tasks
1. [x] Create _work_efforts_ folder structure with Johnny Decimal system
2. [x] Update hotline subtext in dist/index.html
3. [x] Document the change

## Changes Made

### Initial Update (2025-12-26)
### dist/index.html (line 711)

**Before:**
```html
<div class="hotline-subtext">Got a random weird question? I bet I can answer it in under an hour.</div>
```

**After:**
```html
<div class="hotline-subtext">Click to email me your weird question. Once I see it, I'll respond and start working on it within the hour.</div>
```

### CTA Text Update (2025-01-27)
### src/index.html

**Hero Section (line 153):**
- **Before:** `"Click to email your weird question. I'll respond within the hour."`
- **After:** `"Click to email your weirdest question. Let's solve it together."`

**Final CTA Section (line 359):**
- **Before:** `"Send me your weird question. I'll get back to you within the hour."`
- **After:** `"Send me your weirdest question. Let's crack it together."`

## Progress
- Created `_work_efforts_/00-09_site_improvements/00_ui_ux/` folder structure
- Created index file at `00.00_index.md`
- Updated subtext copy to clarify email action and timing promise
- Removed time promise from both CTA locations
- Replaced with value-focused, exciting copy that emphasizes collaboration

## Notes
- The mailto link already pointed to christopher@fogsift.com - no change needed there
- Kept the playful tone while adding clarity about the mechanism
- Removed time-based promise to make CTAs more exciting and enticing
- Focus shifted from time commitment to value and collaboration
