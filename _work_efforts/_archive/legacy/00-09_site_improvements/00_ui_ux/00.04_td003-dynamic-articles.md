## Status: Completed
**Started:** 2025-12-26 18:45
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-26 18:50

## Objective
Remove hardcoded article content from modal.js and load from articles.json instead.

## Tasks
1. [x] Update modal.js to fetch articles.json
2. [x] Update build.js to copy articles.json to dist/content/
3. [x] Update TECH_DEBT.md to mark TD-003 as complete

## Changes Made

### src/js/modal.js
- Added `articles` property for caching
- Added `articlesPath` property pointing to `content/articles.json`
- Added async `loadArticles()` method that fetches and caches articles
- Updated `loadContent()` to use fetched articles
- Updated `init()` to preload articles for faster first open
- Removed hardcoded article content (was ~20 lines)

### scripts/build.js
- Added `src/content/articles.json` to STATIC_ASSETS
- Updated `copyFile()` to create subdirectories (for content/)

## Benefits
- **Content separation**: Articles live in JSON, not code
- **Easy updates**: Add articles without touching JS
- **Smaller bundle**: Article text moved out of app.js
- **Caching**: Articles fetched once and cached

## Notes
- Articles preloaded on init for fast first modal open
- Graceful fallback if fetch fails
- Build now copies articles.json to dist/content/
