# Work Effort: Wiki CSS Layout Fix

## Objective
Fix wiki page rendering issues where content was hidden under fixed navigation

## Problem
Wiki pages (index and articles) were not rendering content - only the fixed navigation was visible. Content was positioned off-screen due to CSS specificity issues and malformed HTML.

## Root Cause
1. **Malformed HTML**: Both wiki templates (`wiki-index-template.html` and `wiki-template.html`) had a tag mismatch - `<nav id="mobile-drawer">` was closed with `</div>` instead of `</nav>`, causing browsers to nest subsequent content incorrectly inside the mobile drawer.

2. **CSS file not included**: The `src/css/wiki.css` file was created but not added to the `CSS_FILES` array in `scripts/build.js`, so wiki-specific styles weren't being bundled.

## Tasks
- [x] Identify why wiki content wasn't visible
- [x] Add wiki.css to build.js CSS bundle
- [x] Fix malformed HTML in wiki-index-template.html (`</div>` → `</nav>`)
- [x] Fix malformed HTML in wiki-template.html (`</div>` → `</nav>`)
- [x] Remove debug `!important` declarations from CSS
- [x] Verify wiki renders correctly in light and dark modes
- [x] Clean up temporary test files

## Files Changed
- `scripts/build.js` - Added `src/css/wiki.css` to CSS_FILES array
- `src/wiki-index-template.html` - Fixed closing tag (line 53: `</div>` → `</nav>`)
- `src/wiki-template.html` - Fixed closing tag (line 53: `</div>` → `</nav>`)
- `src/css/wiki.css` - Removed `!important` from body padding-top

## Result
Wiki pages now render correctly:
- Index page shows header, category cards, and footer
- Article pages show sidebar navigation and main content
- Both light and dark modes work properly
- Breadcrumb navigation displays correctly
- All wiki links function as expected

## Verification
- Tested wiki index page visually
- Tested "Getting Started" article page
- Verified dark mode toggle works
- Built project successfully (6 wiki pages generated)
