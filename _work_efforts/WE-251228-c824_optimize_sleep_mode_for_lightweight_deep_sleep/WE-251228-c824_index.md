## Objective
Make sleep mode ultra-lightweight on user's device after the initial falling asleep animation completes. Keep the visual charm but eliminate continuous CPU/GPU usage.

## Tickets

| ID | Title | Status |
|----|-------|--------|
| TKT-c824-001 | Add deep sleep state and timer to sleep.js | pending |

| TKT-c824-003 | Test and verify resource usage improvement | pending |

## Progress
- 12/28/2025: Implemented deep sleep mode that kicks in 3 seconds after entering sleep. Stops canvas animation loop, removes floating Zs and decorations, freezes all CSS animations via deep-sleep class.

## Progress
- 12/28/2025: Improved deep sleep transition to feel natural: 1) Added settling-to-sleep transition class, 2) Smooth fade out of toasters and Zs over 1.5s, 3) Added cozy vignette effect, 4) Kept slow dreamy glow animation on sleep icon, 5) Dimmed content more for peaceful feeling

## Progress
- 12/28/2025: Final version: Deep sleep now shows sleeping elements clearly with transparent overlay, small corner badge for tap to wake, and smooth fade transition for toasters/Zs. Tested and working.

## Progress
- 12/28/2025: Added clear sleep status card: centered modal with 💤 icon, 'TAP TO WAKE' text, and friendly message 'We noticed you stepped away, so we dimmed the lights.' Orange border matches brand. Sleeping elements visible behind soft tint.
