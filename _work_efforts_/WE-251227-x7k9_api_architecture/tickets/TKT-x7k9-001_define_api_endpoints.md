# TKT-x7k9-001: Define API Endpoint Schema

## Metadata
- **Created**: Friday, December 27, 2025 at 9:30:00 AM PST
- **Parent Work Effort**: WE-251227-x7k9 (API Architecture)
- **Author**: ctavolazzi

## Description
Document all API endpoints with their request/response contracts, error codes, and example payloads. This serves as the contract between the build system and client-side code.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All endpoints documented with URL, method, response shape
- [ ] TypeScript-style interfaces defined for all responses
- [ ] Error codes and messages specified
- [ ] Example requests/responses provided for each endpoint

## Endpoints to Define

1. `/api/wiki/index.json` - Full wiki structure
2. `/api/wiki/sitemap.json` - JD-numbered sitemap data
3. `/api/articles.json` - Field notes content
4. `/api/meta.json` - Site version, build date
