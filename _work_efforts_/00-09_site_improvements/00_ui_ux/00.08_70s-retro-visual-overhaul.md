## Status: Completed
**Started:** 2025-12-27 06:15
**Completed:** 2025-12-27 06:25

## Objective
Transform FogSift from cold brutalist tech aesthetic to warm, confident 70's/80's retro-modern style that matches the logo and profile badge.

## What Was Done

### Phase 1: Foundation (Tokens)
- **Color palette overhaul**: Replaced cold grays with warm colors
  - Cream backgrounds (`#f5f0e6`, `#e8e0d0`)
  - Chocolate text/borders (`#4a2c2a`, `#6b4423`)
  - Burnt orange CTA (`#e07b3c`)
  - Kept teal for links (`#0d9488`)
- **Typography**: Added Outfit display font, confident letter-spacing
- **Border/radius system**: Rounded corners (badge aesthetic), softer shadows

### Phase 2: Structure Simplification
- Reduced from 12+ sections to 5 clean sections:
  1. Hero (badge-style card)
  2. Process (3 numbered steps)
  3. About (photo + bio card)
  4. Pricing (3 tier cards)
  5. Contact (footer CTA)

### Phase 3: Complexity Removal
- **Removed**:
  - Floating CTA button
  - Progress bar
  - Breadcrumb navigation
  - Diagnostic checklist
  - IO boxes in process section
  - Tech stack tags
  - Capabilities grid
  - Emoji decorations in pricing
- **Kept**:
  - Toast notifications
  - Theme toggle (light/dark)
  - Mobile hamburger menu

### Phase 4: Component Design
- Badge-style cards with rounded corners
- Pill-shaped CTA buttons
- Horizontal section dividers
- Clean pricing cards with featured highlight

### Phase 5: Polish
- Dark mode adaptation (dark chocolate with cream text)
- Mobile responsive layout
- Simplified JS (~80 lines vs ~200 before)
