# Work Effort: Hotline Button Clarity

## Status: Completed
**Started:** 2025-12-26 18:14
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-26 18:15

## Objective
Improve the "Weird Question Hotline" button to make it clearer that:
1. Clicking it sends an email to christopher@fogsift.com
2. The "under an hour" response time starts when Christopher sees the message (not when sent)

## Tasks
1. [x] Create _work_efforts_ folder structure with Johnny Decimal system
2. [x] Update hotline subtext in dist/index.html
3. [x] Document the change

## Changes Made

### dist/index.html (line 711)

**Before:**
```html
<div class="hotline-subtext">Got a random weird question? I bet I can answer it in under an hour.</div>
```

**After:**
```html
<div class="hotline-subtext">Click to email me your weird question. Once I see it, I'll respond and start working on it within the hour.</div>
```

## Progress
- Created `_work_efforts_/00-09_site_improvements/00_ui_ux/` folder structure
- Created index file at `00.00_index.md`
- Updated subtext copy to clarify email action and timing promise

## Notes
- The mailto link already pointed to christopher@fogsift.com - no change needed there
- Kept the playful tone while adding clarity about the mechanism
