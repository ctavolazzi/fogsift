## 1. Project Understanding

### What FogSift Is
FogSift is a **diagnostic consulting business** run by Christopher Tavolazzi. The tagline: *"Straight answers to complicated questions."* The service model is simple:
- Client pays $20 via Ko-fi
- Gets 1 hour of focused diagnostic attention
- Walks away with a fix, a roadmap, or a referral

**Target audience:** C-suite, VPs of Operations, Directors of Strategy at mid-to-large companies ($10M-$500M+ revenue) in manufacturing, tech, healthcare, and professional services.

### Technical Architecture
- **Stack:** Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS — no frameworks, by design decision (2025-12-26)
- **Build:** Monolithic `scripts/build.js` (1,291 lines) — template replacement, CSS concat, JS minification via esbuild
- **Hosting:** Cloudflare Pages with Workers (serverless functions)
- **Dev server:** browser-sync on port 5050
- **Themes:** 11 themes + demo mode with auto-cycling
- **Wiki:** 44 markdown pages across 6 categories, compiled at build time
- **Search:** Full-text search index built at compile time (56 pages indexed)
- **Queue system:** Ko-fi webhook → Cloudflare KV → queue display
- **Security:** HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, Permissions-Policy all configured

3. **Security** — Cookie consent, data collection audit, legal compliance
4. **Infrastructure** — Component library, test suite viewer, development tooling
5. **Professionalism** — Branded development tools, documented processes

---

## 3. Release Infrastructure (GitHub Features)

### GitHub Features to Use
- **Milestone:** "v0.1.0 — Functional Product"
- **Issues:** Break work into trackable units
- **Labels:** priority/critical, priority/high, type/feature, type/fix, type/docs, type/infra
- **Project Board:** Kanban for v0.1.0 work
- **Branch:** `release/v0.1.0` from main
- **Pull Request:** Formal PR with checklist
- **Release:** Tagged release with changelog
- **Discussions:** (optional) For architectural decisions

## 4. Security & Compliance Audit Plan

### Already in Place
- HSTS with preload

### Needs Work
- [ ] Cookie consent banner (opt-in/opt-out, GDPR/CCPA compliant)
- [ ] Cookie audit (what cookies are actually set?)
- [ ] Data collection inventory (what data flows where?)
- [ ] Privacy policy review (does it match actual behavior?)
- [ ] Legal disclaimer accuracy check
- [ ] CSP audit (is 'unsafe-inline' necessary for scripts/styles?)
- [ ] Dependency audit (npm audit)
- [ ] Form security review (all inputs sanitized?)

## 8. FogSift Lore

### The Utility Suite: "The Lighthouse"
*Because when the fog rolls in, you need a lighthouse.*

### Characters

**Captain FogLift**
- Role: The main diagnostic engine — the hero who cuts through the fog
- Personality: Stoic, methodical, Witcher-meets-Captain-America energy
- Catchphrase: "The fog doesn't lift itself."
- In the tooling: Captain FogLift represents the build system, the tests, the quality gates — the things that ensure clarity
- Visual: A lighthouse keeper in a long coat, lantern in hand, standing at the edge of visibility

**Foggie Sifter**
- Role: The narrator, the personality, the one who makes it fun
- Personality: Radio DJ energy — thinks everything is fascinating, talks too fast, gets excited about edge cases
- Catchphrase: "Good morning fog-dwellers! You're listening to WSFT, and have I got a signal for you today..."
- In the tooling: Foggie Sifter represents the UI, the component library, the developer experience — the things that make work enjoyable
- Visual: Headphones around neck, coffee in hand, surrounded by monitors showing waveforms and data

**Their Dynamic**
- Captain FogLift: "The build failed. Three accessibility violations."
- Foggie Sifter: "Ooh, three! That's actually down from twelve. Let me pull up the replay..."
- They complement each other: rigor + enthusiasm, structure + creativity
