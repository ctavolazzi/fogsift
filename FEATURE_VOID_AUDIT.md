3. **Calendly/booking integration** - Reduce friction to zero

4. **Add Open Graph meta tags** (15 min)

## Risk Assessment

**Without These Features:**
- **Lost leads:** No email capture = visitors leave forever
- **Lost credibility:** No testimonials = "Is this person real?"
- **Lost conversions:** Mailto links = 50%+ drop-off vs contact forms
- **Lost insights:** No analytics = flying blind
- **Lost SEO:** No sitemap = reduced discoverability

**Estimated Impact:** Implementing Phase 1-2 could increase conversion rates by **3-5x** based on industry benchmarks.

---

## Conclusion

FogSift has excellent content and clean architecture but lacks the **conversion infrastructure** that consulting websites need to generate leads. The wiki is a hidden gem that could drive SEO traffic if properly optimized.

**Top 5 Actions to Take Now:**
1. Add client testimonials (even 2-3 is transformative)
2. Embed Calendly booking widget
3. Build email capture with lead magnet
4. Add contact form (not just mailto)
5. Enable analytics

These five changes would transform FogSift from a "digital business card" into a **lead generation engine**.
