## Priority Matrix

### Must-Have (Do First)

1. **Client testimonials section** - Social proof is non-negotiable
2. **Email capture with lead magnet** - Passive lead generation
3. **Calendly/booking integration** - Reduce friction to zero
4. **LinkedIn profile link** - Basic credibility verification
5. **Analytics (Plausible/Cloudflare)** - Measure everything

7. **XML sitemap** - SEO baseline

### Should-Have (Do Next)

8. **Video testimonials** - 2-3x more effective than text
9. **Search functionality** - Wiki is great but hard to navigate
10. **Social sharing buttons** - Amplify reach
11. **Sticky CTA bar** - Catch scrollers
12. **Credentials/certifications display** - Build authority
13. **Structured data** - SEO enhancement

### Nice-to-Have (Future)

3. **Enable Cloudflare Analytics** (5 min)
4. **Add Open Graph meta tags** (15 min)
5. **Create placeholder testimonials section** (30 min)

---

## Risk Assessment

**Without These Features:**
- **Lost leads:** No email capture = visitors leave forever
- **Lost credibility:** No testimonials = "Is this person real?"
- **Lost conversions:** Mailto links = 50%+ drop-off vs contact forms
- **Lost insights:** No analytics = flying blind
- **Lost SEO:** No sitemap = reduced discoverability

**Estimated Impact:** Implementing Phase 1-2 could increase conversion rates by **3-5x** based on industry benchmarks.

---

## Conclusion

FogSift has excellent content and clean architecture but lacks the **conversion infrastructure** that consulting websites need to generate leads. The wiki is a hidden gem that could drive SEO traffic if properly optimized.

**Top 5 Actions to Take Now:**
1. Add client testimonials (even 2-3 is transformative)
2. Embed Calendly booking widget
3. Build email capture with lead magnet
4. Add contact form (not just mailto)
5. Enable analytics

These five changes would transform FogSift from a "digital business card" into a **lead generation engine**.
