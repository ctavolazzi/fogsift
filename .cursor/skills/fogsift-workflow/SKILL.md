# FogSift Workflow
Use this skill when working on FogSift tasks that require the full workflow.

## When to Use
- Starting multi-step work that needs tracking
- Updating rules/commands/hooks/skills or docs

## Instructions
- Run `date` at session start.
- Check `_work_efforts/` and update `devlog.md` with plan and results.
- Follow the work effort + ticket flow in `AGENTS.md`.
- Keep changes additive and confirm before destructive operations.
