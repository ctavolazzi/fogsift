- Follow the workflow in `AGENTS.md` and `_work_efforts/devlog.md`.
- Non-destructive, additive changes only; ask before deleting or overwriting.
- NPM commands are allowed when needed; avoid `npm run dev/build` unless explicitly required.
- Prefer MCP tools when available; for repo files use MCP filesystem; for user-level paths use direct tools.
- Use `@Files`, `@Folders`, `@Code`, and `@Docs` intentionally; avoid over-attaching.
- GitHub integration: the Cursor GitHub app is required for cloud agents/Bugbot; use `@cursor` on PRs/issues to trigger agents. Do not change permissions or IP allowlist without explicit request.
- Ignore files: `.cursorignore` blocks semantic search, Tab/Agent/Inline Edit, and @ mentions; terminal/MCP tools are not blocked. Use `.cursorindexingignore` for indexing-only exclusions. Global ignore list can be set in Cursor settings.
- Extensions: Cursor uses Open VSX with additional verification. Install via Extensions panel or `cursor:extension/publisher.extensionname`.
- Parallel agents: worktrees are isolated; use Apply to merge changes. LSP is not supported in worktrees. Optional settings include `cursor.worktreeCleanupIntervalHours`, `cursor.worktreeMaxCount`, and `git.showCursorWorktrees`.
- Keep rules short and link to canonical files instead of copying large content.
