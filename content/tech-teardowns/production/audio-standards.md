- [ ] Have water nearby
- [ ] Turn off notifications
- [ ] Close windows/doors
- [ ] Silence phone

#### Test Recording
- [ ] Record 30-second test
- [ ] Check levels
- [ ] Listen for issues
- [ ] Adjust as needed
- [ ] Record another test if needed

### During Recording

#### Speaking
- **Natural**: Speak naturally, not reading
- **Clear**: Enunciate clearly
- **Pace**: Maintain consistent pace
- **Volume**: Keep volume consistent
- **Energy**: Maintain energy and enthusiasm

#### Monitoring
- **Watch Levels**: Monitor audio levels
- **Listen**: Use headphones to monitor
- **Check**: Periodically check recording
- **Adjust**: Adjust if needed

#### Common Issues
- **Too Quiet**: Increase gain/input level
- **Too Loud**: Decrease gain/input level
- **Background Noise**: Move to quieter location
- **Echo**: Add acoustic treatment or move to smaller room
- **Plosives**: Use pop filter or adjust position

### After Recording

#### Review
- [ ] Listen to entire recording
- [ ] Check for mistakes
- [ ] Note sections for retakes
- [ ] Verify quality
- [ ] Check levels

#### Retakes
- **When**: Mistakes, quality issues, unclear sections
- **How**: Record retakes, mark for editing

## Post-Production Audio

### Basic Processing

#### Noise Reduction
- **Purpose**: Remove background noise
- **When**: If background noise is present
- **How**: Use noise reduction tool in editing software
- **Caution**: Don't over-process (can sound artificial)

#### Normalization
- **Purpose**: Adjust overall volume level
- **Target**: -12 dB to -6 dB average
- **How**: Use normalization tool in editing software
- **Caution**: Don't normalize too high (can cause clipping)

#### Compression
- **Purpose**: Even out volume levels
- **When**: If volume varies significantly
- **How**: Use compression tool in editing software
- **Settings**: Light compression (2:1 to 4:1 ratio)

#### EQ (Equalization)
- **Purpose**: Adjust frequency balance
- **When**: If sound needs frequency adjustment
- **How**: Use EQ tool in editing software
- **Common**: Slight boost in mid-range for clarity

### Advanced Processing (Optional)

#### De-essing
- **Purpose**: Reduce harsh "s" sounds
- **When**: If "s" sounds are too harsh
- **How**: Use de-esser tool in editing software

#### Reverb Reduction
- **Purpose**: Reduce echo/reverb
- **When**: If recording has too much echo
- **How**: Use reverb reduction tool in editing software

#### Limiting
- **Purpose**: Prevent peaks from clipping
- **When**: If peaks are too high
- **How**: Use limiter tool in editing software
