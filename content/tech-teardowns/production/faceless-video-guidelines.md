# Faceless Video Guidelines

**Purpose**: Standards and best practices for producing faceless Tech Teardown videos.

---

## Format Overview

### What is "Faceless" Video?
- **No face on camera**: Face never appears in frame
- **Hands-only focus**: Camera shows hands and device
- **Narration-driven**: Story told through voice and visuals
- **Educational focus**: Content is the star, not personality

### Why Faceless?
- **Focus on content**: Device and story are the stars
- **Universal appeal**: No distraction from the subject
- **Professional feel**: Clean, educational aesthetic
- **Privacy**: Creator remains anonymous
- **Timeless**: No aging or appearance concerns

---

## Camera Setup

### Camera Position
- **Overhead or angled**: Camera positioned above work surface
- **Hands in frame**: Both hands visible when working
- **Device centered**: Device is the focal point
- **Stable mount**: Tripod or fixed mount (no handheld)

### Recommended Angles

#### Overhead Angle (Primary)
- **Position**: Directly above work surface
- **Height**: 2-3 feet above surface
- **Angle**: 90 degrees (straight down)
- **Best for**: Disassembly, component examination
- **Frame**: Hands and device, no background distractions

#### Angled View (Secondary)
- **Position**: 45-degree angle from above
- **Height**: 2-3 feet above and to the side
- **Angle**: 45 degrees
- **Best for**: Showing device depth, component relationships
- **Frame**: Hands, device, and work surface

### Camera Settings
- **Resolution**: 1080p minimum, 4K preferred
- **Frame Rate**: 30fps standard, 60fps for slow motion
- **Focus**: Manual focus recommended (prevents hunting)
- **Exposure**: Manual or locked (prevents flicker)
- **White Balance**: Manual or locked (consistent color)

---

## Lighting Setup

### Primary Lighting
- **Position**: Above and slightly in front of work area
- **Type**: Soft, diffused light (ring light, softbox, or natural window)
- **Intensity**: Bright enough for clear detail, not harsh
- **Color**: Neutral white (5500K-5600K)

### Fill Lighting (Optional)
- **Position**: Opposite side from primary light
- **Purpose**: Reduce harsh shadows
- **Intensity**: 50-75% of primary light
- **Type**: Softer, more diffused

### Avoid
- ❌ Harsh shadows on hands/device
- ❌ Uneven lighting
- ❌ Color casts (yellow, blue)
- ❌ Reflections on device surfaces
- ❌ Bright spots or hot spots

### Lighting Checklist
- [ ] Hands clearly visible
- [ ] Device details visible
- [ ] No harsh shadows
- [ ] Consistent lighting throughout
- [ ] No reflections on device
- [ ] Color looks natural

## Composition Guidelines

### Frame Composition
- **Rule of Thirds**: Device slightly off-center for visual interest
- **Negative Space**: Leave room around device (not cramped)
- **Hand Position**: Hands enter from sides/bottom, not top
- **Device Focus**: Device is always the main subject

### What to Include in Frame
- ✅ Hands (when working with device)
- ✅ Device/components
- ✅ Work surface (clean, uncluttered)
- ✅ Tools (when in use)

### What to Exclude from Frame
- ❌ Face (never visible)
- ❌ Body/torso
- ❌ Cluttered background
- ❌ Distracting objects
- ❌ Personal items
- ❌ Reflections of face

### Background
- **Clean Surface**: Plain, neutral work surface
- **Color**: Neutral (white, gray, wood)
- **Texture**: Simple, not distracting
- **Consistency**: Same background throughout video

---

## Hand Presentation

### Hand Positioning
- **Purposeful**: Every hand movement has a purpose
- **Smooth**: No fidgeting or nervous movements
- **Confident**: Show expertise through steady hands
- **Visible**: Hands clearly visible, not hidden

### Hand Gestures
- **Pointing**: Use index finger to point at components
- **Holding**: Hold device/components clearly
- **Demonstrating**: Show how things work or fit together
- **Avoid**: Fidgeting, tapping, unnecessary movements

### Hand Appearance
- **Clean**: Clean hands (wash before filming)
- **Neat**: Trimmed nails (if visible)
- **No Jewelry**: Remove rings, watches (can scratch devices)
- **No Distractions**: Nothing that draws attention from device

---

## Device Presentation

### Showing the Device
- **Full View**: Show entire device when introducing
- **Close-ups**: Zoom in for detail shots
- **Multiple Angles**: Show from different angles when helpful
- **Component Focus**: Highlight interesting components

### Device Handling
- **Careful**: Handle with care (respect the device)
- **Purposeful**: Every movement has a reason
- **Steady**: No shaky movements
- **Clear**: Device clearly visible at all times

### Component Presentation
- **Isolated**: Show components individually when explaining
- **Labeled**: Use text overlays to label components
- **Compared**: Show size comparisons when relevant
- **Context**: Show how components relate to whole device

---

## Movement and Pacing

### Camera Movement
- **Minimal**: Keep camera still (no unnecessary movement)
- **Smooth**: If moving, move slowly and smoothly
- **Purposeful**: Only move to follow action or show detail
- **Stable**: Use tripod, no handheld

### Pacing
- **Not Rushed**: Take time to show details
- **Not Slow**: Keep momentum, don't drag
- **Natural**: Pace should feel natural, not forced
- **Varied**: Mix fast and slow sections

### Transitions
- **Smooth**: Smooth transitions between shots
- **Logical**: Transitions make sense (follow the story)
- **Not Jarring**: Avoid jump cuts unless intentional
- **Consistent**: Use consistent transition style
