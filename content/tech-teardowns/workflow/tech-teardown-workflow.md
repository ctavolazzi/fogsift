## Overview

This workflow guides the complete production of Tech Teardown videos for FogSift. Each teardown follows a 4-step process designed to create engaging, educational content about vintage tech devices.

## The 4-Step Process

### Step 1: Find an Old Gadget

**Objective**: Source and evaluate vintage tech devices for teardown.

**Activities**:
1. **Research & Discovery**
   - Identify historically significant devices
   - Research device availability and pricing
   - Evaluate market for vintage tech
   - Document interesting devices in a candidate list

2. **Selection Criteria**
   - Historical significance (did it change the industry?)
   - Interesting backstory (politics, drama, controversy)
   - Technical interest (unique components, design decisions)
   - Availability and cost
   - Teardown feasibility (not too complex, not too simple)

3. **Device Acquisition**
   - Source device (eBay, thrift stores, collectors, etc.)
   - Verify condition and completeness
   - Document purchase details
   - Take initial "before" photos

4. **Pre-Teardown Documentation**
   - Record device specifications
   - Document external condition
   - Note any visible damage or modifications
   - Create device profile in project folder

**Deliverables**:
- Device research document
- Device selection justification
- Initial device photos
- Device specifications sheet

### Step 2: Tear It Apart

**Objective**: Systematically disassemble the device while documenting every step.

**Activities**:
1. **Preparation**
   - Set up filming area (good lighting, stable surface)
   - Prepare tools (screwdrivers, pry tools, camera)
   - Review device documentation if available
   - Plan disassembly approach

2. **Disassembly Process**
   - Work methodically, one component at a time
   - Photograph/video each step
   - Document screw locations and types
   - Note any surprises or interesting discoveries
   - Handle delicate components carefully

3. **Component Cataloging**
   - Photograph each major component
   - Label components if needed
   - Document component relationships
   - Note any unusual or interesting parts
   - Record component dimensions if relevant

4. **Discovery Documentation**
   - Note design decisions (good and bad)
   - Document manufacturing techniques
   - Record any modifications or repairs
   - Capture interesting engineering choices
   - Document any "aha!" moments

**Deliverables**:
- Disassembly log with photos
- Component catalog
- Video footage of disassembly
- Discovery notes

### Step 3: Explain the History

**Objective**: Research and narrate the device's history, politics, drama, and significance.

**Activities**:
1. **Historical Research**
   - When was it made? By whom?
   - What problem did it solve?
   - Who were the key players?
   - What was the competitive landscape?
   - What was happening in the industry at the time?

2. **Politics & Drama Research**
   - Corporate politics around the device
   - Competitive battles
   - Controversies or scandals
   - Failed partnerships or deals
   - Industry reactions and responses

3. **Significance Research**
   - How did it change the industry?
   - What came before and after?
   - What technologies did it enable or kill?
   - What lessons can we learn?
   - Why does it matter today?

4. **Script Writing**
   - Structure: Introduction → History → Politics → Significance → Conclusion
   - Write for hands-only narration (describe what you're showing)
   - Include specific details and anecdotes
   - Keep it engaging and educational
   - Aim for 10-20 minutes of content

5. **Video Production (Faceless, Hands-Only)**
   - Set up camera to show hands and device
   - Use good lighting (natural or studio)
   - Record clear audio (lavalier mic recommended)
   - Show device components while narrating
   - Use close-ups for interesting details
   - Keep hands visible and purposeful

**Deliverables**:
- Research document with sources
- Narration script
- Recorded video footage
- Audio track

### Step 4: Try to Put It Back Together

**Objective**: Attempt to reassemble the device, documenting successes and failures.

**Activities**:
1. **Reassembly Planning**
   - Review disassembly photos and notes
   - Organize components
   - Plan reassembly sequence (reverse of disassembly)
   - Identify potential challenges

2. **Reassembly Attempt**
   - Work methodically, following reverse order
   - Document each step
   - Note any difficulties or surprises
   - Photograph/video the process
   - Handle delicate components carefully

3. **Success or Failure Documentation**
   - Did it work after reassembly?
   - What broke or didn't fit?
   - What extra parts were left over?
   - What would you do differently?
   - Capture the honest attempt (success or failure)

4. **Lessons Learned**
   - What did you learn about the device?
   - What did you learn about the process?
   - What would you do differently next time?
   - What surprised you?

**Deliverables**:
- Reassembly log
- Before/after comparison
- Lessons learned document
- Final video footage
