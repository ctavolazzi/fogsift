# Tech Teardown Production Checklist

Use this checklist for each Tech Teardown project to ensure nothing is missed.

## Step 1: Find an Old Gadget

### Research Phase
- [ ] Identified 3-5 candidate devices
- [ ] Researched historical significance of each
- [ ] Evaluated availability and pricing
- [ ] Selected final device with justification
- [ ] Documented selection criteria

### Acquisition Phase
- [ ] Sourced device (purchased/acquired)
- [ ] Verified condition and completeness
- [ ] Documented purchase details
- [ ] Took initial "before" photos
- [ ] Created device profile document

### Pre-Teardown
- [ ] Recorded device specifications
- [ ] Documented external condition
- [ ] Noted any visible damage/modifications
- [ ] Created project folder structure
- [ ] Set up device research document

## Step 2: Tear It Apart

### Preparation
- [ ] Set up filming area (lighting, surface)
- [ ] Prepared tools (screwdrivers, pry tools, camera)
- [ ] Reviewed device documentation
- [ ] Planned disassembly approach
- [ ] Tested camera/lighting setup

### Disassembly
- [ ] Documented each step with photos
- [ ] Recorded video of disassembly process
- [ ] Documented screw locations and types
- [ ] Noted surprises and discoveries
- [ ] Handled delicate components carefully

### Component Cataloging
- [ ] Photographed each major component
- [ ] Labeled components (if needed)
- [ ] Documented component relationships
- [ ] Noted unusual or interesting parts
- [ ] Recorded component dimensions (if relevant)

### Discovery Documentation
- [ ] Noted design decisions (good and bad)
- [ ] Documented manufacturing techniques
- [ ] Recorded modifications or repairs
- [ ] Captured interesting engineering choices
- [ ] Documented "aha!" moments

## Step 3: Explain the History

### Research
- [ ] Researched device history (when, who, why)
- [ ] Researched politics and drama
- [ ] Researched industry significance
- [ ] Found multiple sources for facts
- [ ] Fact-checked all claims
- [ ] Cited sources in documentation

### Script Writing
- [ ] Structured script (Intro → History → Politics → Significance → Conclusion)
- [ ] Wrote for hands-only narration
- [ ] Included specific details and anecdotes
- [ ] Kept it engaging and educational
- [ ] Aimed for appropriate length (10-20 min)

### Video Production
- [ ] Set up camera for hands-only view
- [ ] Configured good lighting
- [ ] Tested audio recording
- [ ] Recorded narration with device components
- [ ] Used close-ups for interesting details
- [ ] Kept hands visible and purposeful
- [ ] Recorded clear audio track

## Step 4: Try to Put It Back Together

### Reassembly Planning
- [ ] Reviewed disassembly photos and notes
- [ ] Organized components
- [ ] Planned reassembly sequence
- [ ] Identified potential challenges

### Reassembly Attempt
- [ ] Worked methodically (reverse order)
- [ ] Documented each step
- [ ] Noted difficulties and surprises
- [ ] Photographed/videoed the process
- [ ] Handled delicate components carefully

### Documentation
- [ ] Documented success or failure
- [ ] Noted what broke or didn't fit
- [ ] Recorded extra parts (if any)
- [ ] Created before/after comparison
- [ ] Documented lessons learned

## Post-Production

### Editing
- [ ] Edited video footage
- [ ] Synced audio with video
- [ ] Added any necessary graphics/text
- [ ] Color correction and grading
- [ ] Final audio mix

### Publication
- [ ] Created thumbnail image
- [ ] Wrote video description
- [ ] Added tags and metadata
- [ ] Published to platform
- [ ] Shared on social media (if applicable)

### Project Completion
- [ ] Organized all project files
- [ ] Archived raw footage
- [ ] Updated project status
- [ ] Documented final lessons learned
- [ ] Updated content tracking system

## Quality Check

Before publishing, verify:
- [ ] All facts are accurate and cited
- [ ] Video quality is good (clear, stable, well-lit)
- [ ] Audio is clear (no background noise)
- [ ] Hands are visible and purposeful
- [ ] Device components are clearly shown
- [ ] Documentation is complete
- [ ] All deliverables are present

## Notes

- Check off items as you complete them
- Add custom items for specific projects
- Don't skip steps - each adds value
- Take your time - quality over speed
