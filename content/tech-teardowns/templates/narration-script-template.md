## Writing Guidelines

### Writing for Hands-Only Narration

#### Describe What You're Showing
- **Good**: "Here's the main processor, you can see it's a [model]..."
- **Bad**: "This is interesting..." (without describing what "this" is)

#### Use Spatial Language
- **Good**: "On the left side, we have...", "At the top, you'll notice..."
- **Bad**: "Over here..." (vague)

#### Be Specific
- **Good**: "This is a 32-bit processor running at 25 MHz..."
- **Bad**: "This is a processor..." (too vague)

#### Match Visuals
- **Good**: Script matches what's on screen
- **Bad**: Talking about one thing while showing another

### Pacing Guidelines

#### Timing
- **Average Speaking Rate**: 150-160 words per minute
- **For 10-minute video**: ~1,500 words
- **For 20-minute video**: ~3,000 words

#### Pauses
- **Natural Pauses**: Allow time for viewer to process
- **After Key Points**: Pause after important statements
- **During Actions**: Pause during disassembly actions

#### Variation
- **Mix Fast and Slow**: Vary pace to maintain interest
- **Emphasize Important Points**: Slow down for key information
- **Speed Up Less Important**: Move quickly through routine parts

### Tone and Style

#### Educational but Engaging
- **Informative**: Provide real information
- **Engaging**: Keep it interesting, not dry
- **Conversational**: Sound natural, not robotic
- **Authoritative**: Show expertise, but be accessible

#### Avoid
- ❌ Overly technical jargon (unless explaining it)
- ❌ Condescending tone
- ❌ Too casual or unprofessional
- ❌ Reading directly from script (sound natural)

## Example Script Excerpt

### Introduction Example
```
[0:00] In 1993, Apple released a device that would change everything.
Or at least, that's what they hoped.

[0:15] The Newton MessagePad was supposed to be the future of computing.
A personal digital assistant that could recognize your handwriting,
organize your life, and fit in your pocket.

[0:30] But the Newton became one of the most famous failures in tech history.
Today, we're going to tear one apart, explore why it failed,
and see if we can put it back together.

[0:45] This is the story of ambition, innovation, and the harsh reality
of bringing new technology to market.
