## Red Flags (Avoid These)

### ❌ Too Simple
- **Problem**: Not enough to explore
- **Example**: Basic calculator, simple radio
- **Solution**: Look for more complex devices

### ❌ Too Complex
- **Problem**: Impossible to fully understand
- **Example**: Modern smartphone (too many components)
- **Solution**: Look for devices with visible complexity

### ❌ No Story
- **Problem**: Nothing interesting happened
- **Example**: Generic product with no history
- **Solution**: Look for devices with documented history

### ❌ Too Expensive
- **Problem**: Budget constraints
- **Example**: Rare collectibles worth thousands
