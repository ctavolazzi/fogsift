# FogSift - How It Works

<img src="../assets/logo-color-transparent.png" alt="FogSift logo" style="width:160px; height:auto; display:block; margin-bottom:10pt;"> FogSift delivers clear answers to good questions, and the service is called Problem Shark Tank with a clear promise: make a decision that matters.

The flow is Submit -> Review -> Work -> Deliver -> Outcome, and each step is a short gate that keeps the decision moving without extra noise.

Submit means you send a concise problem statement with context, what you tried, and what success looks like so the work can start clean.

Review is the fit and timing check, and we will decide if the problem is a match before it enters active work.

Work is the active analysis phase, and it is important because the thinking happens out loud, with tradeoffs stated plainly.

Deliver means you receive a response package that you can act on immediately, not a vague summary.

Outcome is the final gate and the decision point, because the goal is clarity and momentum, not more noise.

The $20 price is the filter that keeps the queue open while still screening for real intent, and the call to action is simply Join Queue.

What you always get is a recorded problem-solving session on video, filmed end to end so the reasoning is visible.

You also receive a written report that captures findings, what we learned, and the most important decision in plain language.

Direction is guaranteed, and it lands as one of three outcomes with practical next steps you can act on immediately.

The first outcome is "Let's go deeper," which means we found signal and want more work together on the same problem.

The second outcome is "I know people," which means the issue is outside our lane and we will connect you to a better-fit expert.

The third outcome is "This is sick," which means the idea is strong and you should do it, with a clear approach spelled out.
