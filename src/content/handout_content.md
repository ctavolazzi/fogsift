### Focus Session: The $20 Gamble

Something eating up your **time**? **Budget**? **Sanity**?

Let's solve it together.

---

## HOW IT WORKS

| Step | Action | What Happens |
|:----:|--------|--------------|
| **01** | **SUBMIT** | Describe your problem + pay $20. It's the filter that keeps it serious and accessible. |
| **02** | **REVIEW** | Once a day, we review all submissions. We pick two. |
| **03** | **WORK** | Up to an hour of focused problem-solving. Filmed, no face. |
| **04** | **DELIVER** | You get the video + a written report. Always. |
| **05** | **OUTCOME** | One of three paths forward. Either way, you got something. |

## THE DEAL

**$20** gets you into the queue.

It's the filter that keeps it serious and keeps it open to anyone who can get a job at McDonald's.

A full-on research squad (me + AI + friends + network) focuses on your submission for up to an hour.

We pick **2 per day** — one from the top, one at random.

Limited to **10 slots/week**.

## WHAT YOU ALWAYS GET

**The Video**
Me working on your problem out loud, like a scientist in the lab. Think Wilson from Home Improvement — voice over the fence, pure problem-solving, no performance.

**The Report**
Written findings documenting what we tried and what we learned. A formal record of the investigation.

**Direction**
One of three outcomes with clear next steps. You never walk away empty-handed.

## THE THREE OUTCOMES

**"Let's go deeper."**
We see something here. We'd like to work on this more with you. Here's what we think we could accomplish together...

**"I know people."**
This isn't our wheelhouse, but we know exactly who can help. Want us to set it up?

**"This is sick."**
This would be cool if somebody did it. You have this opportunity. Here's how we'd approach it...
