## $20. Up to One Hour. Let's See What Happens.

You've got a problem eating your time, bandwidth, budget, or sanity.
We bring a full-on research squad (me + AI + friends + network) focused on your submission for up to an hour.

Here's the deal: You pay $20. $20 is the accessibility filter that keeps it serious and keeps it open to anyone who can get a job at McDonald's. Worth way more than $20, kept low so anyone can access it. We work on your submission for up to an hour. You receive a PDF write-up and a video response. We may or may not publish a video. Your submission may be used for other purposes, including marketing. Request anonymization if needed.

**You always get something:**
- A video response scoped to your submission
- A formal PDF write-up with what we found

Maybe I solve it. Maybe I don't. But either way, you walk away with something.

## How It Works

1. **Submit**: Describe your problem + pay $20
2. **Review**: Once a day, I review submissions and choose what to work on next
3. **Work**: Up to an hour of focused work on your submission
4. **Deliver**: PDF write-up and a video response
5. **Outcome**: One of three paths forward

## The Three Outcomes

After the hour, I'll reach out with one of these:

**"Let's go deeper."**
I see something here. I'd like to work on this more with you.
Here's what I think we could accomplish together...

**"I know people."**
This isn't my wheelhouse, but I know exactly who can help.
Want me to set it up? (Finder's fee applies, but you get the right expert.)

**"This is sick. You should do it."**
This would be fucking cool if somebody did it. You have this opportunity.
Here's how I'd approach it if I were you...

## The Fine Print

**By submitting, you agree:**
- We may or may not publish a video
- Your submission may be used for other purposes, including marketing
- You can request anonymization (company/name redacted)

**Why this model?**
- **For you**: Low-risk entry ($20), kept intentionally low so anyone can access it, you always get something back
- **For me**: Content pipeline, lead magnet, income stream, and I get to work on interesting problems

A Focus Session is a research squad focused on your submission for up to an hour. Worth way more than $20, kept low so anyone can access it.
You might get your thing solved. You might get valuable response material to act on. Either way, $20 well spent.
