# How to Talk to AI: A Field Guide for Humans

## The Problem

You're talking to AI wrong. Not morally wrong - strategically wrong.

Most people treat AI like a search engine. They type "write me a marketing email" and get generic slop. Then they complain that AI "doesn't work."

The problem isn't the AI. The problem is the conversation.

## The Core Principle

**AI is a conversation partner, not a vending machine.**

You wouldn't walk up to a consultant and say "fix my business." You'd explain the context, the constraints, the history, the goals. Then you'd have a back-and-forth until you arrived at something useful.

AI works the same way.

## The Five Laws of Effective AI Communication

### 1. Context Is King

Bad: "Write me a tagline."

Good: "I run a consulting business that helps small manufacturing companies find inefficiencies in their operations. My clients are typically plant managers who are skeptical of outsiders. Write me a tagline that speaks to their skepticism while promising practical results."

The difference? Context.

### 2. Show, Don't Just Tell

Bad: "Write in a professional tone."

Good: "Here's an example of writing I like: [paste example]. Match this voice."

AI learns from examples faster than instructions.

### 3. Iterate, Don't Regenerate

Bad: *reads output* "Ugh, that sucks." *clicks regenerate*

Good: "This is close, but the second paragraph is too formal. Make it more conversational while keeping the technical accuracy."

Regenerating throws away progress. Iterating builds on it.

### 4. Think Out Loud

Bad: "Give me a marketing strategy."

Good: "I'm thinking about my marketing strategy. My current approach is X, but it's not working because Y. I've considered A, B, and C. What am I missing?"

When you share your thinking, AI can engage with your actual reasoning - not just guess what you want.

### 5. Assign a Role

Bad: "Review my code."

Good: "You are a senior software engineer conducting a code review. Focus on security vulnerabilities and performance issues. Be direct about problems - don't sugarcoat."

Role assignment activates different "modes" of AI behavior.

## The Prompt Framework

Here's a simple framework for any AI interaction:

```
CONTEXT: What's the situation?
ROLE: Who should the AI be?
TASK: What specifically do you need?
FORMAT: How should the output look?
CONSTRAINTS: What should it avoid?
```

**Example:**

> CONTEXT: I'm preparing for a job interview at a fintech startup.
> ROLE: You are an experienced hiring manager in fintech.
> TASK: Give me the 5 most likely technical questions I'll face.
> FORMAT: List each question, then explain what they're really testing for.
> CONSTRAINTS: Focus on practical scenarios, not textbook trivia.

## Common Mistakes

### The Lazy Ask
"Write me something good."

AI can't read your mind. Vague inputs = vague outputs.

### The Kitchen Sink
"Write me a 5000-word comprehensive guide covering every aspect of..."

Overwhelming requests produce overwhelmed outputs. Break big tasks into smaller chunks.

### The One-Shot Expectation
Expecting perfect results on the first try.

Plan for 3-5 iterations. The first response is a starting point, not a finish line.

### The Privacy Dump
Sharing sensitive information (passwords, financial data, personal identifiers).

AI isn't a secure vault. Treat every conversation as potentially public.

## Quick Wins

**For Writing:**
"Write a first draft. I'll refine it. Prioritize [X] over perfection."

**For Analysis:**
"Here's my data. What patterns do you see? What questions should I be asking?"

**For Learning:**
"Explain [topic] to me like I'm [familiar with X but not Y]."

**For Debugging:**
"Here's my code and the error. Walk me through your debugging process step by step."

**For Brainstorming:**
"Give me 10 ideas for [X]. Include 3 safe options and 3 wild ones."

## The Meta-Skill

The real skill isn't prompting. It's thinking clearly about what you want.

AI forces you to articulate:
- What problem am I actually solving?
- What does success look like?
- What constraints matter?
- What context is relevant?

These questions are valuable whether you're talking to AI, a colleague, or yourself.

## Start Here

1. Pick one thing you've been trying (and failing) to get AI to help with.
2. Apply the CONTEXT-ROLE-TASK-FORMAT-CONSTRAINTS framework.
3. Iterate 3 times before judging the result.

That's it. No magic. Just clear thinking and good conversation.
