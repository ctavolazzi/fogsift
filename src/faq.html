            <h2>The Queue</h2>

            <h3>What happens after I pay?</h3>
            <p>You'll get a confirmation email with a form to describe your problem. Fill it out with as much detail as you can. Your submission enters the queue, and I pick from it daily.</p>

            <h3>How long until my problem gets picked?</h3>
            <p>It varies. I pick two per day: one highest-rated by the community, one random. Could be tomorrow, could be next week. The random selection means everyone has a fair shot regardless of when they submitted.</p>

            <h3>What if my problem never gets picked?</h3>
            <p>If you've been in the queue for 30 days without being selected, reach out and I'll either work your problem or refund your $20. No one gets left behind.</p>

            <h3>Can I request anonymity?</h3>
            <p>Yes. When you submit, you can request that identifying details be obscured. I'll still work the problem publicly (so others can learn), but your name and company won't be visible.</p>

            <h2>The Work</h2>

            <h3>What kinds of problems do you work on?</h3>
            <p>Business and operational problems that are stuck. Process bottlenecks, decision paralysis, team dysfunction, unclear strategy, technical architecture questions. If you're spinning your wheels on something, it probably fits.</p>

            <h3>What if my problem is too big for an hour?</h3>
            <p>Most problems can at least be clarified in an hour. I'll identify the real issue and outline a path forward. If it needs more work, we can discuss a deeper engagement.</p>

            <h3>What if you can't solve it?</h3>
            <p>Not every problem has a clean solution. But every problem can be better understood. I'll show you what I find, even if the answer is "this is harder than it looks" or "here's why you're actually stuck."</p>

            <h3>Do you give specific advice or just frameworks?</h3>
            <p>Both. I'll give you concrete recommendations where I can. When I can't, I'll give you the framework to figure it out yourself. No vague platitudes.</p>

            <h2>The Video</h2>

            <h3>Why do you work on camera?</h3>
            <p>Transparency. You see exactly how I think through problems. No black box consulting where you get a polished deck with no insight into how we got there. Plus, others can learn from watching.</p>

            <h3>Where are videos published?</h3>
            <p>On the <a href="https://youtube.com/@fogsift" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FogSift YouTube channel</a>. Each session becomes an episode. You get access to the video plus a written summary.</p>

            <h3>Can I request my video not be published?</h3>
            <p>The public format is core to how this works. If your problem requires true confidentiality, the queue isn't the right fit. Consider a <a href="offers.html">private engagement</a> instead.</p>

            <h2>Money</h2>

            <h3>Why $20?</h3>
            <p>Low enough to be accessible. High enough to filter for people who are serious. The price isn't the point; the work is.</p>

            <h3>Do you offer refunds?</h3>
            <p>If your problem sits in the queue for 30+ days without being picked, yes. If you're dissatisfied with the work, let's talk. I'd rather make it right than keep your money.</p>

            <h3>What's the catch?</h3>
            <p>No catch. I genuinely enjoy this work. The low price lets me help more people. The public format means the value compounds as others learn from each session.</p>

            <h2>Other Options</h2>

            <h3>What if the queue doesn't fit my needs?</h3>
            <p>Check the <a href="offers.html">offers page</a> for other options: free triage calls, private deep dives, and contract engagements for bigger projects.</p>

            <h3>Can I just email you a question?</h3>
            <p>Sure. <a href="mailto:christopher@fogsift.com">christopher@fogsift.com</a>. I can't promise a deep answer for free, but I'll point you in the right direction if I can.</p>
