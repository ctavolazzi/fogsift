                    <span class="price">$20</span>
                    <p>A full-on research squad (me + AI + friends + network) focused on your submission for up to an hour. Worth way more than $20, kept low so anyone can access it.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 0.9em; opacity: 0.8; margin-top: 1rem;">Your $20 adds you to <a href="queue.html" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: underline;">the queue</a>. $20 is the accessibility filter that keeps it serious and keeps it open to anyone who can get a job at McDonald's. We work through the queue as capacity allows. You receive a PDF write-up and a video response. We may or may not publish a video. Your submission may be used for other purposes, including marketing. Request anonymization if needed. One-time fee per submission (not a subscription). Maybe we solve it. Maybe we don't. Either way, you walk away with something.</p>

            <h2>What You Get (Always)</h2>
            <p>Every submission receives:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Video Response</strong> - FogSift responding to your submission with our best attempt to move the needle.</li>
                <li><strong>The PDF Write-up</strong> - A written document with what we found, what we tried, and what to do next.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Three Outcomes</h2>
            <p>After the hour, we'll reach out with one of these:</p>

            <h3>"Let's go deeper."</h3>
            <p>We see something here. We'd like to work on this more with you. Here's what we think we could accomplish together...</p>

            <h3>"I know people."</h3>
            <p>This isn't our wheelhouse, but we know exactly who can help. Want us to set it up?</p>

            <h3>"This is sick. You should do it."</h3>
            <p>This would be cool if somebody did it. You have this opportunity. Here's how we'd approach it...</p>

            <h2>The Fine Print</h2>
            <p><strong>By submitting, you agree:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>We may or may not publish a video</li>
                <li>Your submission may be used for other purposes, including marketing</li>
                <li>You can request anonymization (company/name redacted)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is how the model works. Your $20 buys the work, and your submission may be used beyond the response.</p>

            <h2>FAQ</h2>

            <h3>Why $20?</h3>
            <p>Low enough to try. High enough to filter. Kept intentionally low so anyone can access it.</p>

            <h3>What if you don't solve it?</h3>
            <p>You still get the video response and PDF write-up. You still get our notes. You still get direction on what to try next. That's the deal.</p>

            <h3>Will my submission be public?</h3>
            <p>We may or may not publish a video. Your submission may be used for other purposes, including marketing. Request anonymization if needed.</p>

            <h3>Can I stay anonymous?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Just note it in your submission. We'll redact your name and company from any published materials.</p>
