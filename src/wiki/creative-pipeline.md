# The Creative Pipeline

A low-friction workflow for turning ideas into published content. This is the default pipeline for the Future Folk Guild — adapt it to your tools and preferences, but keep the principles.

## The Seven Steps

### 1. Rant First

Open your Notes app (or voice memo, or napkin). Dump everything you're thinking about a topic. Don't organize it. Don't edit it. Just get the raw energy out.

**Why this works:** Most people try to create structure before they have material. That's backwards. Start with the thing you can't stop thinking about. The energy comes first; the container comes second.

### 2. Let AI Add Structure

Copy your rant into ChatGPT, Claude, or your preferred AI tool. Ask it to turn your brain dump into an essay outline with sections and key points.

**Why this works:** You're not outsourcing your thinking — you already did the thinking in Step 1. You're outsourcing the *organizing*, which is a different skill that doesn't require your creative energy.

### 3. Record Your Voice

Using GarageBand (iPhone), a voice recorder app, or similar — talk through your topic using the outline from Step 2. You're not reading a script. You're having a structured conversation with yourself.

**Why this works:** Speaking forces you to articulate ideas in real time. You hear yourself think. Bad arguments sound bad immediately. Good arguments develop a natural rhythm that writing alone can't capture.

### 4. Walk and Film

Go for a walk. Take footage with your phone. A handheld stabilizer helps but isn't required. You can film while you walk, or use a second device.

**Why this works:** Walking is a thinking tool. The footage you capture has natural movement and texture that looks better than any static setup. And you're getting exercise and fresh air, which makes the editing phase easier.

### 5. Combine in Your Editor

Import your audio and footage into CapCut, DaVinci Resolve, or your preferred editor. Layer the audio over the walking footage.

### 6. Edit With a Time Box

Edit your video. Add effects if you want, but keep it minimal.

**The Rule: No more than 1 hour of editing per 15 minutes of footage.**

This constraint is sacred. Without it, editing becomes infinite. With it, you ship. Shipping is the only thing that separates a creator from a person with ideas.

### 7. Export and Save in Two Places

1. **The Archive** — a folder of every version you've ever exported. You'll forget most of them exist, but you'll be glad they're there when you need them.
2. **The Latest** — a single location that always contains your most recent version. Delete old versions from here. This is your "ready to publish" folder.

You now have: your raw materials (rants, outlines, audio, footage), your workspace (editor project file), your drafting table (work in progress), and your archive (everything you've ever made).

## The Principles

### Friction Is the Enemy

Every step in this pipeline exists to reduce the distance between having an idea and publishing it. If a step adds friction without adding value, remove it.

### Energy Before Structure

Always start with what excites you. Structure is a tool for organizing energy, not a substitute for it.

### Time Boxes Make Things Real

Unlimited time produces unlimited revision. Constraints produce finished work.

### Ship Before It's Perfect

A published video at 80% quality teaches you more than an unpublished video at 95% quality. The feedback loop only works if you close it.

## Connection to FogSift

FogSift's mission is removing friction between knowing and doing. The consulting practice does this for businesses — turning vague symptoms into clear diagnoses. The Creative Pipeline does the same thing for creators — turning raw ideas into published artifacts.

Same philosophy. Different domain.

## Future Folk Guild

The Future Folk Guild is a membership community built around this philosophy. Members get access to pipeline templates, feedback loops, and a community of people who are all building their own friction-reduction machines.
