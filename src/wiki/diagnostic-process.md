# The Diagnostic Process

Every Fogsift engagement follows a consistent diagnostic process. The specific tools vary, but the structure remains the same.

## Phase 1: Intake

### Symptom Collection

We start by gathering every symptom, complaint, and observation. No filtering. No prioritization yet. Just collection.

**Key questions:**
- What exactly is happening?
- When did you first notice it?
- Who noticed it first?
- What has been tried so far?

### Stakeholder Mapping

Who cares about this problem? Who is affected? Who has information? We map the stakeholder landscape before we start investigating.

### Constraint Identification

What can't change? What's off-limits? Understanding constraints early prevents wasted effort on solutions that can't be implemented.

## Phase 2: Investigation

### Trace Protocol

We follow the [TRACE Protocol](/wiki/frameworks/trace-protocol.html) to systematically investigate the problem:

1. **T**arget the symptom
2. **R**ecord the evidence
3. **A**nalyze the chain
4. **C**hallenge assumptions
5. **E**xpose the root

### Evidence Gathering

We collect data, documents, interviews, and observations. Everything gets documented. Nothing is too small to note.

### Pattern Recognition

As evidence accumulates, patterns emerge. We look for:
- Recurring failures
- Common factors across incidents
- Timing correlations
- Process gaps

## Phase 3: Analysis

### Causal Chain Mapping

We build a visual map of cause and effect, tracing from symptoms back to origins. This reveals:
- Where the chain breaks
- Where multiple causes converge
- Where interventions will be most effective

### Hypothesis Testing

We don't just guess. We form hypotheses and test them against the evidence. If the evidence doesn't support the hypothesis, we revise.

### Root Cause Identification

The root cause is the point where intervention will prevent recurrence. It's rarely the first thing you think of, and almost never "human error."

## Phase 4: Recommendations

### Solution Design

We design solutions that address the root cause, not just the symptoms. Good solutions are:
- Specific and actionable
- Proportional to the problem
- Within the organization's constraints
- Sustainable without ongoing intervention

### Implementation Roadmap

We provide a clear sequence of steps, with dependencies mapped and quick wins identified. The roadmap includes:
- What to do first
- What can be done in parallel
- What requires sequential completion
- How to measure progress

### Risk Assessment

Every solution has risks. We identify them upfront:
- What could go wrong?
- What are the early warning signs?
- What's the fallback plan?

## Phase 5: Transfer

### Documentation

We document everything: the investigation, the findings, the recommendations, and the reasoning. This documentation becomes part of your organizational knowledge.

### Training

We ensure your team understands not just *what* to do, but *why*. This enables them to adapt the solution and handle similar problems in the future.

### Follow-up

We check in after implementation to verify the solution is working and make adjustments if needed.

*The process is rigorous, but flexible. The goal is always the same: find the truth, fix the problem, transfer the knowledge.*
