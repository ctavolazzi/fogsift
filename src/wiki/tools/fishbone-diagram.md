# Fishbone Diagrams

A fishbone diagram (also called Ishikawa or cause-and-effect diagram) visually maps the potential causes of a problem. It's particularly useful when multiple factors might contribute and you need to systematically explore possibilities.

## The Structure

```
        ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

The "head" of the fish is the problem. The "bones" are categories of potential causes. Smaller bones are specific causes within each category.

## Building the Diagram

### Step 1: Define the Problem

Write the problem clearly at the head of the fish. Be specific. "Customer complaints" is too vague. "Customers complaining about delivery time" is better.

### Step 2: Choose Categories

Draw major bones for each category of causes. Common category sets:

**Manufacturing (6 Ms):**
- Man (People)
- Machine (Equipment)
- Method (Process)
- Material (Inputs)
- Measurement
- Mother Nature (Environment)

**Services (8 Ps):**
- Price
- Promotion
- People
- Processes
- Place/Plant
- Policies
- Procedures
- Product

**Or create your own:**
- Systems
- People
- Process
- External
- (Whatever fits your context)

### Step 3: Brainstorm Causes

For each category, brainstorm potential causes. Add them as smaller bones. Don't evaluate yet, just collect.

### Step 4: Dig Deeper

For each cause, ask "why?" Add sub-causes as even smaller bones. This is where the Five Whys technique combines with fishbone diagrams.

### Step 5: Analyze

Look for:
- Causes that appear in multiple categories
- Clusters of related causes
- Causes with strong evidence
- Causes that are actionable

### Step 6: Prioritize

Not all causes are equal. Use evidence and judgment to identify the most likely root causes. Investigate those first.

## Example

**Problem:** High employee turnover

| Category | Causes |
|----------|--------|
| **People** | Poor hiring fit, Inadequate onboarding, Manager quality, Team dynamics |
| **Process** | Unclear expectations, No career path, Slow decision-making, Too much bureaucracy |
| **Compensation** | Below market salary, Unclear bonus structure, Limited benefits, No equity |
| **Culture** | Toxic behaviors tolerated, No recognition, Work-life imbalance, Lack of purpose |
| **Environment** | Poor tools, Office location, Remote policy, Physical workspace |
| **External** | Competitor recruiting, Industry trends, Economy, Geographic factors |

After investigation, you might find the primary drivers are "Manager quality" and "No career path," with "Below market salary" as a contributing factor.

## When to Use It

- Complex problems with multiple potential causes
- Group brainstorming sessions
- When you need to ensure comprehensive analysis
- When different stakeholders have different theories
- Teaching teams to think systematically about causation

## When It Doesn't Work

### Too Many Causes

If you generate 50 causes, the diagram becomes unwieldy. Prioritize or group similar causes.

### No Investigation

Fishbone diagrams generate hypotheses. They don't prove anything. Each suspected cause needs verification.

### Consensus Theater

Sometimes teams use fishbone diagrams to create false agreement. Everyone's theory goes on the diagram, but no one's theory gets tested.

### Linear Problems

If the cause is straightforward, a fishbone diagram is overkill. Use [Five Whys](/wiki/tools/five-whys.html) instead.

## Best Practices

### Use in Groups

Fishbone diagrams work best as group exercises. Different perspectives surface different causes.

### Be Specific

"Communication problems" is too vague. "Status updates not reaching stakeholders" is better.

### Include Data

Where possible, attach evidence to causes. "Manager quality" backed by "Exit interviews cite manager in 60% of departures" is more persuasive.

### Iterate

The first pass is rarely complete. Revisit after investigation. Add what you've learned. Remove what's been ruled out.

### Avoid Blame

Keep the focus on systems and processes, not individuals. "John's errors" isn't useful. "Inadequate training for complex tasks" is useful.

## Combining with Other Tools

- **Five Whys:** For each bone, ask why to find deeper causes
- **Pareto Analysis:** Prioritize which causes to address first
- **TRACE Protocol:** Use the fishbone in the "Analyze" phase
