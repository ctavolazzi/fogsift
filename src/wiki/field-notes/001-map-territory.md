# Field Note: The Map Is Not The Territory

Most organizations confuse their organizational chart with their actual communication network.

When we deploy the Trace protocol, we find the critical node is often a Scheduler in a basement office. Not the VP. Not the Director. The person who actually knows where everything is.

## The Observation

Org charts show reporting lines. They don't show:

- Who actually gets called when something breaks
- Who knows where the bodies are buried
- Who can get things done without a meeting

These informal networks are the real operating system of an organization. The org chart is just the marketing brochure.

## The Implication

When diagnosing organizational problems, start by mapping the *actual* information flow:

1. **Who gets CC'd on everything?** That's a power node.
2. **Who do people call before escalating?** That's a trust node.
3. **Who's in every meeting?** That might be a bottleneck.

## The Action

Next time you're troubleshooting a process failure, don't look at the org chart. Look at the email threads. Look at the Slack channels. Look at who's standing at whose desk.

The map is not the territory.
