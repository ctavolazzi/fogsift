# The Adjacent Problem

*Organizations routinely solve the problem next to the real problem. The adjacent solution is easier to access, feels productive, and rarely fixes the thing that needed fixing.*

## The Pattern

A sales team is missing quota. The diagnosis: the sales deck is outdated. The solution: redesign the sales deck.

The deck gets redesigned. It looks better. The team uses it. Quota continues to be missed.

The actual problem was that the team was targeting the wrong customer segment — accounts too small to generate the deal sizes needed to hit quota. The sales deck had nothing to do with it.

The redesigned deck was the adjacent problem: something real, adjacent to the actual issue, that was easier to identify and fix. Working on it felt like progress. It wasn't.

## Why Adjacent Problems Get Solved

**Diagnosis is difficult; identification is easy.** The adjacent problem is visible. It presents itself. You can see that the deck is outdated, the process is messy, the communication is unclear. The underlying problem may require careful investigation to surface.

**Adjacent solutions have clear owners.** "Who fixes the sales deck?" has an obvious answer. "Who fixes the sales targeting strategy?" may not — it involves sales leadership, marketing, product, and finance simultaneously.

**Adjacent solutions are faster.** Redesigning a deck takes a week. Repositioning a sales motion takes a quarter. Organizations under pressure often choose the faster intervention, even when it's less likely to work.

**Adjacent solutions look like competent action.** When a problem exists, leadership feels pressure to respond visibly. Fixing an adjacent problem is a visible response. Doing the harder work of accurately diagnosing the actual problem can look like inaction.

**Adjacent problems are less politically uncomfortable.** The real problem often implicates something or someone in the organization — a strategy decision, a product gap, an organizational design failure, a leadership mistake. The adjacent problem usually doesn't. Working on the adjacent problem is the path of least friction.

## Common Adjacent Problem Pairs

**Real problem → Adjacent problem often chosen instead:**

*Strategy isn't producing results* → communication about the strategy needs improvement

*The product doesn't solve a real problem* → the marketing needs to be clearer

*The team is underperforming because of poor management* → team-building activities and training programs

*The organization has a structural misalignment between incentives and desired outcomes* → more meetings about alignment

*The diagnostic process is revealing problems that leadership doesn't want to address* → the diagnostic process needs to be improved

*Customer churn is driven by product quality gaps* → the onboarding experience needs to be redesigned

*A process consistently produces poor outcomes* → the documentation of the process needs to be updated

These patterns recur because adjacent problems are often real and worth fixing. The error is treating them as substitutes for the actual problem rather than as separate issues to address in their own right.

## How to Tell Adjacent From Actual

The distinction between adjacent and actual problems is often only clear in retrospect — which is why rigorous diagnosis matters before intervention.

**Ask: if this is fixed, does the core symptom resolve?** If sales deck quality was causing quota misses, improving the deck should improve quota attainment. If it doesn't, the deck wasn't the problem.

**Work backward from the mechanism.** Sketch the causal chain from the proposed solution to the desired outcome. Where are the links weak or missing? If the chain requires several speculative connections, the problem may be adjacent rather than actual.

**Ask what else must be true.** For the adjacent solution to work, what else has to be true? If the conditions required are not reliably present, the solution probably won't hold.

**Investigate before proposing.** Adjacent problems often surface quickly in casual observation. The actual problem often requires deliberate investigation: interviews, data analysis, process observation. If the proposed solution emerged before investigation happened, it's a candidate for the adjacent problem trap.

**Track outcomes, not activities.** "We redesigned the deck" is an activity metric. "Sales attainment improved" is an outcome metric. Organizations that track activities can feel productive while solving adjacent problems indefinitely.

## The Organizational Conditions That Produce It

The adjacent problem pattern is more common in organizations with certain characteristics:

**Pressure to act fast.** Urgency compresses diagnosis. When leadership demands visible action quickly, adjacent problems get solved because they're faster to act on.

**Measurement of effort rather than outcome.** Organizations that reward effort and visible activity are less likely to notice when effort is being directed at the wrong problem.

**Low tolerance for uncomfortable findings.** If the actual problem implicates strategy, leadership, or organizational design, surfaces it will create political discomfort. In organizations where that discomfort is avoided, diagnostic conclusions get softened until they point at adjacent, comfortable problems.

**Consulting and implementation culture.** Consultants are often brought in to implement solutions, not to diagnose. If the solution is already defined (however imprecisely), the work naturally optimizes toward that solution — which may be the adjacent one.

## The Diagnostic Fix

The pattern that prevents adjacent problem solving:

1. **State the symptom precisely.** Not "we have a communication problem" but "in the last six months, three initiatives failed to receive adequate cross-team coordination, resulting in X, Y, and Z specific failures."

2. **Generate multiple hypotheses.** What are three to five different explanations that would produce this symptom? Don't stop at the first candidate.

3. **Test each hypothesis.** What evidence would confirm or disconfirm each? Collect that evidence before committing to a solution.

4. **Check for adjacent proximity.** For each leading hypothesis, ask: is this the actual problem or is it adjacent to a harder problem I'm not investigating?

5. **Define the outcome test.** Before implementing the solution, specify: "If this is the actual problem, we should observe [specific outcome change] within [timeframe]."
