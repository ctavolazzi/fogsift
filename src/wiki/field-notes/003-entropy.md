# Field Note: Entropy

Chaos is the default state. Order requires energy injection. If you stop pushing, the system decays.

## The Law

The Second Law of Thermodynamics, translated for business:

> Every system tends toward disorder unless energy is continuously applied to maintain order.

Your documentation will rot. Your processes will drift. Your culture will dilute. Not because anyone wants it to. Entropy is the universe's default setting.

## The Observation

Organizations that stop actively maintaining their systems don't stay the same. They get worse:

- **Undocumented processes** don't stay undocumented. They become *inconsistent* processes.
- **Unclear ownership** doesn't stay unclear. It becomes *contested* ownership.
- **Deferred maintenance** doesn't stay deferred. It becomes *emergency* maintenance.

## The Math

Entropy is cheap. Order is expensive. But disorder is *most* expensive.

The cost curve looks like this:

1. **Prevention**: $1 (continuous small investments)
2. **Correction**: $10 (periodic fixes when drift is noticed)
3. **Crisis**: $100 (emergency intervention when systems fail)

Most organizations budget for correction and pay for crisis.

## The Action

Build maintenance into the system:

- **Scheduled reviews**: Don't wait for problems to surface
- **Forcing functions**: Make decay visible before it's critical
- **Ownership rituals**: Someone must be responsible for fighting entropy

You can't stop entropy. But you can budget for it.

*The fight against entropy is not optional. It's the cost of having systems at all.*
