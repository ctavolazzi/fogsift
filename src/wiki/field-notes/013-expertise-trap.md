# Field Note 013: The Expertise Trap

*When you hire an expert, you're not just hiring their knowledge. You're hiring their pattern library — and the problems they don't see because those patterns don't contain them.*

## The Pattern

A problem emerges. Leadership brings in an expert. The expert does exactly what experts do: recognizes familiar patterns, applies established frameworks, recommends proven solutions.

The recommendation is technically sound. It's also wrong for this situation.

What happened? The expert saw the problem through their expertise, not through the problem itself. They matched the situation to their pattern library and prescribed accordingly. The pattern was close but not right, and the difference mattered.

This is **the expertise trap**: the ways that deep specialization distorts problem perception and limits solution space.

## How Expertise Distorts Perception

**Pattern overfitting.** Experts get fast and confident by pattern-matching. The efficiency that makes them valuable also makes them prone to categorizing a novel situation as a familiar one. "This is a classic X problem" closes off inquiry that might reveal it's actually a Y problem with X-like surface features.

**Solution-first framing.** Experts know what they can do well. Problems get unconsciously shaped to match the expert's toolkit. A consultant who specializes in restructuring frames problems as organizational design issues. A technologist frames problems as technical problems. This isn't dishonesty — it's the natural result of having expertise with a specific set of solutions.

**Depth at the expense of breadth.** The more expert someone is in a domain, the less likely they are to look outside it. An HR expert addressing high turnover may never examine whether the compensation structure is the real issue — that's a finance problem, outside their domain.

**Familiarity blindness.** Experts stop asking questions that feel obvious. They skip the basic investigation because they already know the answer. But the "obvious" context is often where the actual problem lives.

## When Expertise Becomes a Liability

Not all problems. The expertise trap is most costly in:

**Novel situations.** Problems in the tails of the distribution — the ones that are genuinely unusual — are exactly the ones most likely to be misdiagnosed by experts whose patterns are calibrated to the center of the distribution.

**Cross-domain problems.** Organizational challenges that span multiple functions (sales + operations + technology, for example) resist single-domain expertise. Each expert explains the problem from their vantage point; none of them can see the whole.

**Problems with hidden root causes.** When the presenting problem isn't the actual problem, expertise in addressing presenting problems makes the misdiagnosis more confident and more costly.

**Situations where "what worked before" doesn't apply.** Historical expertise carries the implicit assumption that the environment is similar to the one in which the patterns were formed. Environmental shifts — technology changes, regulatory changes, market structure changes — can render deep expertise not just unhelpful but actively misleading.

## The Expert's Blind Spot

There's a specific type of knowledge that experts lose over time: beginner's questions.

A beginner walking into a situation asks "why does it work this way?" An expert already knows. The problem is that "why does it work this way?" is often exactly the question the situation needs.

Experts have learned to not ask questions that "everyone knows the answer to." This economy of attention is efficient under normal conditions. In abnormal situations, the unasked beginner's question is the one that would have changed everything.

## Diagnostic Signals

You may be in the expertise trap when:

- The recommended solution is identical to what the expert has recommended before for seemingly different problems
- The expert begins with the solution before fully understanding the problem
- Questions outside the expert's domain are redirected back into it ("that's really a people issue") without justification
- The problem diagnosis is completed faster than the situation complexity warrants
- Stakeholders who know the organization well feel unheard
- Early recommendations don't change significantly as more information is gathered

---

## What To Do

**Define the problem before calling the expert.** The problem statement shapes who you bring in. If you haven't diagnosed at least the domain of the problem, you can't select the right expertise.

**Bring in deliberately mismatched expertise.** Include someone from outside the problem's apparent domain. A manufacturing expert on a culture problem. A behavioral economist on a sales problem. Their job isn't to solve it — it's to ask the questions the domain experts have stopped asking.

**Preserve access to the people who know the organization.** Expert recommendations that don't incorporate ground-level knowledge from the people doing the work are systematically missing information that matters.

**Watch for solution stability.** In genuine diagnosis, the solution should evolve as understanding deepens. If the recommended solution doesn't change as more information comes in, the expert is pattern-matching, not diagnosing.

**Separate diagnosis from prescription.** Get the problem defined before bringing in the person whose job is to solve it. The diagnostic phase should be somewhat detached from the solution provider.

---

## The Paradox

The people most qualified to identify whether expertise is being misapplied are experts in the meta-problem of expertise — which is itself a kind of expertise. Organizations that are good at recognizing the expertise trap have usually been burned by it enough times to build the pattern.

The first-time trap is the most expensive.
