# Field Note: Tribal Knowledge

The most critical information in an organization is often stored in heads, not systems.

## The Observation

Client had a quality problem. Intermittent defects. No obvious pattern. We ran the standard diagnostics: reviewed procedures, checked equipment calibration, analyzed process parameters. Everything looked fine on paper.

Then we spent a day on the shop floor.

Watched an operator set up a machine. He made an adjustment that wasn't in the procedure. A slight tweak to the positioning.

"What's that for?"

"Oh, this machine drifts. If you don't offset by about two thousandths, you get rejects."

"Is that documented anywhere?"

"No, you just have to know."

That adjustment was the difference between good parts and scrap. It was known to three operators. When any of them were absent, defect rates spiked.

## The Problem with Tribal Knowledge

### It's Fragile

When the person who knows leaves, takes vacation, or gets sick, the knowledge goes with them. Organizations that run on tribal knowledge are one resignation away from crisis.

### It's Inconsistent

Different people "know" different things. Their personal versions of the unwritten rules conflict. Quality becomes dependent on who's working that day.

### It's Invisible

You can't improve what you can't see. Tribal knowledge exists outside formal systems. It doesn't show up in audits, process maps, or training materials. It's organizational dark matter.

### It's Often Wrong

What one generation of workers figured out gets passed down, but the reasoning is lost. The tribal knowledge might have been correct once, but conditions changed. Now it's superstition masquerading as expertise.

## Finding Tribal Knowledge

### Watch, Don't Read

The gap between documented procedure and actual practice is where tribal knowledge lives. Observe what people actually do. Note the differences.

### Ask the Right Questions

- "Is there anything you do that isn't in the procedure?"
- "What do new people get wrong until they learn the tricks?"
- "If you're out sick, what goes wrong?"
- "What would you tell your replacement that isn't written down?"

### Follow the Failures

When defects or problems occur, ask "who was working?" Patterns in personnel often point to tribal knowledge that some have and others don't.

## What to Do About It

### Document It

Once you find tribal knowledge, write it down. Add it to procedures, training materials, or work instructions. Convert head-knowledge to system-knowledge.

### Verify It

Just because someone "knows" something doesn't make it true. Test tribal knowledge. Is that adjustment actually necessary? Does that workaround actually work? Challenge the folklore.

### Reward Sharing

Tribal knowledge persists because it feels like power. Knowing what others don't creates job security. Change the incentives. Reward people for documenting and sharing their knowledge.

### Systematize It

Where possible, build tribal knowledge into the system itself. Error-proofing, automated adjustments, checklists: these eliminate dependence on individual knowledge.

## The Resolution

We documented the machine offset and a dozen similar undocumented practices. Updated procedures. Built verification into the setup checklist.

Defect rate dropped 60%. More importantly, it became consistent regardless of which operator was on shift.

## The Takeaway

The most dangerous knowledge isn't the knowledge you don't have. It's the knowledge you don't know you're depending on.
