# Field Note 014: The Reorg Trap

*A reorganization is a decision to treat a structural problem as the cause of other problems. Sometimes that's right. Usually it's not.*

---

## The Pattern

Something isn't working. Performance is off. Teams aren't collaborating. A function is underdelivering. Leadership convenes. A restructuring is announced.

Six months later, a new problem emerges in the newly configured structure. Another restructuring is announced.

This is the reorg trap: the recursive pattern where organizational restructuring becomes the default response to organizational dysfunction, while the underlying causes remain unaddressed.

The appeal of reorgs is real. They're visible, decisive, and can be framed as action. They demonstrate that leadership is doing something. But they address the surface configuration of the system rather than the incentives, information flows, norms, and capabilities that determine how any configuration actually performs.

---

## Why Reorgs Get Overused

**Structural problems are legible.** An org chart is visible. Who reports to whom, what's grouped with what — these are things you can draw. Incentive misalignments, capability gaps, and cultural norms are less visible. Leaders default to what they can see and change.

**Reorgs provide a reset narrative.** "This is a new structure. Prior problems are prior problems." The restructuring creates a permission slip to attribute past failures to the old structure rather than the people or decisions involved.

**Decision latency.** The effects of a restructuring take 12-18 months to fully materialize. Leaders are often gone or onto the next challenge before the full consequences of the previous restructure are visible.

**They signal change without requiring change.** A reorg is change in the formal structure. Actual change — in how people behave, what they prioritize, how they make decisions — is much harder and more uncomfortable to drive.

## What Reorgs Can and Cannot Fix

**What restructuring can address:**
- True coordination failures where teams with high interdependence are separated
- Accountability gaps where responsibility isn't clearly owned
- Genuine growth-related organizational scale issues (a team structure that worked at 20 people genuinely may not work at 200)
- External repositioning that requires aligning internal structure to new strategy

**What restructuring typically cannot fix:**
- Poor management practices (these travel with managers through the reorg)
- Incentive structures that reward the wrong things
- Capability gaps (a team reorganized with the same people has the same skills)
- Toxic culture or interpersonal dysfunction
- Unclear strategy (reorgs don't create strategic clarity; they depend on it)
- Trust deficits between groups

The persistent error is applying a structural solution to a behavioral or capability problem.

## The Signal

One diagnostic: if the same people are involved in the new structure as were in the old one, and the incentives haven't changed, and the processes haven't changed — what is expected to be different?

This doesn't mean reorgs are never appropriate. It means the question of *what specifically will be different* should be answered before the reorg, not assumed.

Common vague answers that signal the reorg is avoidance:
- "This will improve collaboration"
- "This aligns us to the strategy"
- "This removes duplication"

These are conclusions, not mechanisms. Collaboration, strategic alignment, and deduplication are outcomes, not guaranteed effects of structural change. What specifically will cause them?

---

## The Hidden Costs

Reorgs are not free. The obvious costs:
- Transition energy (months of productivity lost to uncertainty, reestablishing relationships, learning new reporting lines)
- Political capital spent on the announcement and management of the change
- Morale disruption (people who liked their previous configuration feel loss)

The less obvious costs:
- Informal networks break. The relationships that made things actually work — across formal reporting lines — get disrupted. These take time to rebuild and may not rebuild the same way.
- Institutional knowledge fragments. The person who knew how a particular process worked now reports to someone who doesn't need that knowledge.
- Reorg fatigue accumulates. Organizations that restructure repeatedly develop cynicism. Subsequent restructurings have diminishing credibility.

---

## When the Reorg Is Actually Right

The key test: can you articulate the specific mechanism by which the new structure produces better outcomes?

"Product and engineering under one leader will reduce the handoff latency we're currently experiencing between teams that need to coordinate 30+ times per quarter" is a mechanism.

"Aligning around customers instead of functions will make us more customer-centric" is not a mechanism — it's a hope.

Reorgs that are right typically:
- Have specific coordination problems they're solving, not general ones
- Leave most incentives and processes unchanged (or change those explicitly alongside structure)
- Are driven by strategy that has already been decided, not by the reorg itself
- Don't reconfigure things that are working

---

## The Alternative

Before the reorg, the harder set of questions:

*What specific things aren't working, and why aren't they working?*

If the answers include "because the incentives reward behavior X but we need behavior Y" or "because the team lacks capability Z" or "because the manager in that role isn't suited to it" — those are not structural problems.

Structural problems: the right people, with the right incentives, trying to do the right thing, can't succeed because of how the organization is configured.

Behavioral and capability problems don't become structural problems by drawing a new org chart.
