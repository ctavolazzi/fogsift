In CNC machining, precision and accuracy are different things. Understanding this distinction changes how you diagnose problems, in manufacturing and everywhere else.

## The Definitions

**Precision** is repeatability. Can you hit the same spot every time?

**Accuracy** is correctness. Is that spot the *right* spot?

You can be precise without being accurate (hitting the same wrong spot every time). You can be accurate without being precise (hitting near the right spot but inconsistently).

## The Manufacturing Example

A CNC mill that consistently cuts 0.002" too deep has a precision problem *and* an accuracy problem. But they have different causes:

- **Precision issues** → mechanical wear, thermal expansion, vibration
- **Accuracy issues** → calibration, tool measurement, coordinate systems

Fixing vibration won't fix a calibration error. Recalibrating won't fix a worn bearing.

## The Strategic Parallel

Organizations have the same distinction:

- **Precise but inaccurate**: Consistent processes that produce the wrong outcome
- **Accurate but imprecise**: Right goals, inconsistent execution
- **Neither**: Chaos

## The Diagnostic Question

When something's not working, ask:

1. Is it *consistently* wrong? (Precision is fine, accuracy is off)
2. Is it *inconsistently* wrong? (Accuracy might be fine, precision is off)
3. Is it *randomly* wrong? (Both are off, or you're measuring wrong)

The answer tells you where to look.

## The Action

Before you start fixing, measure twice:

- Are you hitting the same spot? (Precision check)
- Is that spot where you intended? (Accuracy check)

Different problems. Different solutions.
