# Field Note 011: Vanishing Context

*The most expensive thing that leaves when someone quits isn't their skills. It's what they knew that nobody wrote down.*

## The Pattern

Someone resigns. You schedule the exit interview. You get their login credentials, their project files, their contact list.

What you don't get is the thing that made them effective: the accumulated context. The reason the integration with Vendor X is configured that specific way. The history behind the policy nobody questions. Why the client in sector three gets different pricing. What "just handle it like last time" actually means.

This context didn't live in any system. It lived in a person's head — and now it's walking out the door.

This is **vanishing context**: institutional knowledge that exists nowhere except in the memory of the person who built it.

## Why It's Worse Than It Looks

The immediate cost is obvious: onboarding time, mistakes, re-learning. But the second-order damage is subtler.

**Silent process drift.** New people, lacking context, make reasonable-sounding decisions that slowly diverge from the original intent. No individual change looks wrong. The drift only becomes visible months later — by which point multiple people have built on the wrong foundation.

**Decision debt.** Every undocumented decision that holds becomes a trap for whoever inherits it. "We don't do it that way" is uttered with conviction by someone who has no idea why.

**Fragile single points.** When context is concentrated in one person, that person becomes a bottleneck — not because they're doing it deliberately, but because the organization has quietly made them the only safe path through certain decisions.

## Common Sources

- **Workarounds nobody documented** — hacks that became standard practice
- **Vendor relationship history** — what went wrong, who to actually call
- **Client-specific accommodations** — informal agreements, sensitivities, past friction
- **Technical debt rationale** — why the "wrong" approach was chosen and why it's actually correct given the constraints
- **Failure history** — what was tried before and why it didn't work
- **Informal power maps** — who actually makes decisions vs. who's nominally responsible

## The Diagnostic Question

Ask yourself: *If the three people with the longest tenure all left this month, what would we not know how to do?*

Not skills. Not processes that are documented. The things where institutional knowledge is the only thing making them work.

If the answer comes back as a long list — or if you find yourself saying "we'd figure it out" without conviction — you have a vanishing context problem.

---

## Mitigation Approaches

**Context interviews, not just exit interviews.** The standard exit interview asks where someone's going and what would have kept them. A context interview asks: *What do you know that's not written anywhere? What would surprise your replacement?*

**Decision logs.** Not meeting notes, not action items — logs of *why*. "We chose Option B because Option A failed in 2022 due to..." This is what doesn't get documented by default.

**Named context owners.** For any process or relationship where institutional knowledge is the primary risk, name the owner and a backup. Make the context visible, even if it's not fully documented.

**Overlap hiring.** When possible, hire the replacement before the departure. Not just for handoff meetings — for the kind of informal "hey, how do you usually handle this?" conversations that transfer knowledge no document would capture.

---

## What Not To Do

**Don't try to document everything.** You can't. The attempt creates busywork without capturing the nuance. Focus on the highest-risk context — the knowledge whose absence would cause the worst silent failures.

**Don't treat knowledge bases as the answer.** A knowledge base that nobody updates is noise. A knowledge base that's one person's project becomes yet another knowledge dependency.

**Don't assume the knowledge transfer happened.** "We did an overlap period" doesn't mean the context transferred. Ask the new person what surprised them. That's where the gaps are.

---

## The Underlying Dynamic

Vanishing context is a structural problem, not a personnel problem. Organizations don't lose context because people are careless — they lose it because the incentives all point toward getting work done, not toward documenting why.

Fixing it requires treating context documentation as a first-class work product, not an administrative afterthought.
