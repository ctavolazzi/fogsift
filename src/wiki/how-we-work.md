# How We Work

Fogsift operates differently from traditional consulting. We don't bring pre-packaged solutions. We bring diagnostic capability.

## The Approach

### We Listen First

Most problems are explained wrong. Not because people are bad at explaining, but because the symptoms they're experiencing aren't the actual problem. We spend the first part of any engagement just listening, asking questions, and mapping the terrain.

### We Follow the Evidence

We don't have favorite solutions. We don't push frameworks. We trace the wires from symptom to source, and we let the evidence tell us where to look next.

### We Transfer Knowledge

Our goal is to make ourselves unnecessary. Every engagement includes knowledge transfer so your team can maintain and extend the solutions we develop together.

## Engagement Types

### Diagnostic Sessions

**Duration:** 2-4 hours
**Format:** Intensive Q&A and analysis
**Output:** Written diagnosis with recommendations

Best for: Specific problems where you need an outside perspective.

### Deep Dives

**Duration:** 1-2 weeks
**Format:** Embedded investigation
**Output:** Root cause analysis with implementation roadmap

Best for: Complex, systemic issues that require thorough investigation.

### Retainer

**Duration:** Ongoing
**Format:** On-call access with monthly check-ins
**Output:** Continuous advisory support

Best for: Organizations that need ongoing access to diagnostic expertise.

## What We Don't Do

- We don't do the work for you (we help you understand what work to do)
- We don't provide "best practices" without context
- We don't pretend to know your business better than you do
- We don't sell solutions looking for problems

## Ready to Start?

The first conversation is free. We'll talk about what's going on, and if it's something we can help with, we'll figure out the right format together.
