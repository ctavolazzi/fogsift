# The Content Creation Pipeline

You have an idea. You want it to exist in the world. The distance between those two things is where most ideas go to die.

This pipeline is designed to make that distance as short as possible.

## The Seven Steps

### 1. Capture the Rant

Open your notes app. Write what's on your mind. Don't organize it. Don't edit it. Don't worry about whether it's coherent. The goal is to get the raw material OUT of your head and INTO a form you can work with.

Time: 5-15 minutes. The rant is done when you feel lighter.

### 2. Find the Structure

Paste your rant into an AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, or similar). Ask it to turn your brain dump into an essay outline. The AI isn't writing for you — it's showing you the structure that was already inside your rant. You just couldn't see it while you were inside it.

Time: 2-5 minutes.

### 3. Record Your Voice

Open a recording app (GarageBand on iPhone, or any voice recorder). Talk through your topic using the outline as your guide. The outline is the map; your voice is the territory. You'll find that speaking the structured version feels natural because it came from your own words in the first place.

Time: 10-30 minutes, depending on topic depth.

### 4. Walk and Film

Go for a walk. Bring your phone. Take footage of what you see — a handheld stabilizer helps but isn't required. The walking serves two purposes: you're creating B-roll for your video, and you're giving your body something to do while your mind processes what you just recorded.

A second device dedicated to filming lets you walk and shoot simultaneously.

Time: 20-45 minutes. You were going to walk anyway.

### 5. Assemble

Import your audio and footage into a video editor (CapCut, DaVinci Resolve, or similar). Layer the audio over the footage. Add titles if you want. This is collage, not cinema. Don't overthink it.

### 6. The One-Hour Rule

**Do not spend more than 1 hour of editing time per 15 minutes of footage.**

This constraint exists because perfectionism kills more creative projects than lack of skill ever will. The enemy is not bad quality. The enemy is never shipping. A finished video that's 80% as good as your ideal is infinitely more valuable than a perfect video that lives in your drafts forever.

### 7. Save Smart

Export your finished video and save it in two places:

- **The workspace**: Your current working version. One file. When you make a new version, this one gets replaced. This is where you grab the file when you're ready to publish.
- **The archive**: Every version you've ever exported. You probably won't need most of these. But the peace of mind — knowing nothing is lost — prevents the anxiety that makes you hesitate before making bold edits.

## Why This Works

Each step feeds directly into the next with almost no friction:

- The rant generates raw material
- The AI structures it without rewriting it
- The recording captures your natural voice guided by structure
- The walk generates footage while your mind processes
- The edit layers what you already have
- The constraint prevents perfectionism from stalling you
- The archive prevents loss anxiety from making you timid

There are no decision points that could become blockers. There are no steps that require special equipment or expertise. There are no moments where you need to "feel inspired" — the pipeline replaces inspiration with momentum.

## The Philosophy

The gap between "I have an idea" and "I made a thing" is mostly friction. Bad tools. Too many choices. Perfectionism dressed up as quality control. A vague sense that you should be doing it differently.

This pipeline is not the only way to create content. But it's a way that *works*, consistently, without requiring you to be in a particular mood or have a particular block of free time.

The goal is not to make great content. The goal is to make content, consistently, and let greatness emerge from the practice.
