# Anchoring Bias

*The first number in a conversation has disproportionate influence on all subsequent numbers in the conversation.*

## The Principle

Anchoring bias is the tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information encountered — the "anchor" — when making decisions or estimates. Subsequent judgments are adjusted from the anchor, but the adjustments are typically insufficient.

The effect was first demonstrated by Kahneman and Tversky (1974) in experiments where people spun a wheel of fortune before estimating quantities. People who spun high numbers consistently gave higher estimates than people who spun low numbers — even though the spin was random and everyone knew it.

The anchor doesn't need to be relevant. It doesn't need to be accurate. It doesn't even need to be plausible. It just needs to be present and proximate to the estimation.

## How It Works

The mechanism is adjustment-from-anchor:

1. An initial value is introduced (or imagined)
2. The estimator adjusts away from it toward what seems more accurate
3. The adjustment is typically insufficient — it stops too close to the anchor

The problem is step 3. Even when people know they're adjusting and try to adjust enough, they don't. The anchor exerts a gravitational pull that cognitive effort doesn't fully overcome.

## Where Anchors Come From

**Explicitly stated numbers.** "This project will cost $500K" sets an anchor whether the speaker meant to or not. The person who hears that number adjusts from $500K.

**First offers in negotiation.** The first offer is almost always an anchor. The negotiation happens in the neighborhood of the first offer.

**Budget lines from prior years.** The prior year's budget is an anchor for the current year's budget discussion. Starting from zero-base is genuinely difficult for this reason.

**Uninformative reference points.** In experiments, random numbers, ZIP codes, and social security numbers have all been shown to anchor subsequent estimates. The anchor doesn't need to be meaningful.

**Your own prior estimates.** Once you've written down a number, it anchors your later estimates. This is why it's important to update written estimates deliberately rather than iterating from prior ones.

## Organizational Examples

**Salary negotiation.** Whoever names a number first in salary negotiation sets the anchor. The party that makes the first offer gains an advantage in framing the negotiation's range. Candidates who don't have a number in mind often anchor on the first offer and fail to adjust sufficiently.

**Project scoping.** When a client asks "could this be done in six weeks?" that six-week figure becomes an anchor even if the accurate answer is twelve weeks. Estimates generated in response to an anchor systematically under-account for complexity.

**Real estate pricing.** Asking prices anchor buyer valuations. Houses priced high get offers closer to asking price than houses priced at market rate, even controlling for the same property value.

**Performance reviews.** The initial score given to one dimension of an evaluation anchors subsequent dimensions. This is part of why forced distribution and structured rubrics for performance reviews matter.

**Fundraising asks.** "Would you be willing to donate $100?" produces higher donations than "How much would you like to donate?" The first question anchors on $100.

**Vendor proposals.** The first vendor to propose sets the price anchor for the evaluation. Other vendors are often evaluated against that anchor, even when the anchor is high.

## The Negotiation Implication

In negotiation, the first offer matters more than most people realize:

- First offers anchor the range
- Counteroffers anchor around the first offer
- Extreme first offers can anchor at a level that seems absurd but shifts the final agreement

The common advice to "wait for the other side to make the first offer" is often wrong. If you have a credible, high anchor to establish, establishing it first can be advantageous.

The caveat: anchors that are too implausible can damage credibility and break negotiations. The anchor needs to be defensible, or the attempt backfires.

## Counteracting the Effect

**Be aware of the anchor.** Simply knowing about anchoring doesn't eliminate it, but it reduces it somewhat. Before making an estimate in the presence of an anchor, explicitly ask whether the anchor is appropriate to use.

**Generate your own estimate before hearing others.** If you need to estimate something, do so before attending a meeting where others will present numbers. Once you've heard an anchor, it's extremely hard to think without it.

**Consider extreme alternatives.** Force yourself to consider scenarios significantly above and below the anchor. The deliberate generation of extreme alternatives counteracts the anchor's pull.

**Use reference classes.** Return to base rates: what do similar projects cost? What do comparable negotiations end at? Base rates provide anchor-independent information.

**Challenge the source of the anchor.** If someone states a number, ask where it came from. If it's arbitrary, acknowledge it explicitly. This doesn't eliminate the anchor effect, but it reduces confidence in it.

**In negotiations: make the first offer strategically.** If you're selling, start high. If you're buying, start low. If you have information advantage, use it to set the anchor at an advantageous level.

## The Adjustment Problem

The core challenge is that people don't adjust enough from anchors — they stop adjusting when they reach a value that "seems plausible." This is insufficient. The adjustments needed to reach the true value often feel extreme and are resisted.

Techniques that help:
- Make the adjustment process explicit ("my adjustment from the anchor is X because Y")
- Ask whether your adjusted estimate would exist in this range without the anchor
- Run the exercise separately with different starting points to see if estimates converge
