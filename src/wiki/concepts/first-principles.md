# First Principles Thinking

First principles thinking is the practice of breaking a problem down to its most fundamental truths and reasoning up from there, rather than reasoning by analogy or convention.

## The Principle

> "I think it's important to reason from first principles rather than by analogy. The normal way we conduct our lives is we reason by analogy. We are doing this because it's like something else that was done. But with first principles, you boil things down to the most fundamental truths and then reason up from there." — Elon Musk

Most thinking is derivative. We copy patterns we've seen work elsewhere. First principles thinking asks: *what do we actually know to be true?*

## Why It Matters

Reasoning by analogy is efficient. It's also the reason every new software startup builds the same product with different branding. First principles force you to question assumptions that everyone else treats as fixed.

**Analogy reasoning:** "Other companies in our space charge per seat, so we should too."
**First principles:** "What value do we create? How does that value scale? What pricing model aligns cost with value delivered?"

The first approach is fast. The second is how you find opportunities everyone else missed.

## The Method

### 1. Identify Your Assumptions

What are you taking for granted? What "rules" are you following that might not be rules at all?

- "We need an office to do good work"
- "Enterprise sales require a 6-month cycle"
- "Users won't pay for this feature"

### 2. Break Down to Fundamentals

For each assumption, ask: *Is this a law of physics, or a convention?*

**Laws of physics** can't be broken:
- You can't transmit data faster than light
- You can't create energy from nothing
- Human attention is finite

**Conventions** can be broken:
- "Software is sold through salespeople"
- "Reports must be delivered as PDFs"
- "Meetings are 30 or 60 minutes"

### 3. Rebuild From the Ground Up

Starting from only what you know to be true, construct the best solution. Ignore what exists. Ignore what competitors do. What would you build if you were starting from scratch?

## Example: The $20 Problem Session

Traditional consulting says: "Bill by the hour. Minimum engagement: $10,000."

First principles ask:
- What does the client actually need? → *Clarity on a specific problem*
- How long does initial clarity take? → *Often under an hour*
- What's the barrier to getting help? → *Cost and commitment*
- What's the minimum viable engagement? → *One focused session*

Result: A $20 problem submission that delivers a PDF and video response. Not because other consultants do it. Because the fundamentals say it works.

## Common Traps

### Mistaking Conventions for Laws

"You can't build a profitable business at that price point" is a convention, not a law. The math either works or it doesn't. Check the math.

### Going Too Deep

Not every problem requires first principles. If you're deciding where to eat lunch, analogy reasoning is fine. Save first principles for decisions where the conventional approach is failing or where the stakes justify the effort.

### Ignoring Implementation Reality

First principles give you the theoretical optimum. Reality includes budgets, timelines, politics, and existing systems. The best answer is the one you can actually execute.

### Arrogance

"I figured this out from first principles" sometimes means "I ignored 50 years of industry learning." Other people's solutions exist for reasons. Understand those reasons before dismissing them.

## When to Use This

First principles thinking is expensive. It requires deep thought, domain knowledge, and willingness to be wrong. Use it when:

- The conventional approach is clearly failing
- You're entering a new market or building something novel
- The cost of being wrong is high enough to justify the investment
- You suspect "that's how it's always been done" is the real answer to "why?"
