# Base Rate Neglect

*When specific case information is available, people systematically underweight statistical background information — even when the background information is more relevant.*

## The Principle

Base rate neglect (also called base rate fallacy) is the tendency to ignore or underweight statistical information about how common something is — the base rate — when more vivid, specific information about the case at hand is available.

Kahneman and Tversky demonstrated this with the famous "Linda problem": people were given a description of Linda as a socially conscious, philosophy-studying young woman, then asked whether she was more likely to be (a) a bank teller or (b) a feminist bank teller. Most respondents chose (b) — even though (b) is logically impossible to be more probable than (a), since feminists are a subset of bank tellers. The specific description made (b) feel more representative, overwhelming the base rate logic.

Base rate neglect is distinct from simply being wrong about probabilities. It's the systematic pattern of case-specific information driving out statistical background information.

## Why Base Rates Are Ignored

**Representativeness.** People estimate probability by asking "how similar is this case to my mental model of the category?" When a case seems highly representative of a category — Linda seems like a feminist — category membership feels likely regardless of base rates.

**Vividness asymmetry.** Statistical base rates are abstract and impersonal. Case-specific information is concrete and narrative. The vivid, specific case dominates the abstract statistic in attention and memory.

**Inside view pull.** The inside view of a situation — the specific details, the particular circumstances, the unique features — is always available. The outside view — what usually happens in situations like this — requires deliberate construction. The inside view wins by default.

**Lack of causal story.** People are more willing to use information when they can construct a causal mechanism that connects it to the outcome. Base rates often lack obvious causal connections to the specific case, making them feel irrelevant even when they're not.

## Organizational Manifestations

**New product forecasting.** When companies forecast revenue for new products, they focus on the specific features, the target market, and the competitive positioning — all inside-view information. Base rates for new product success in their industry are rarely consulted. The typical new product underperforms forecasts significantly; this pattern persists partly because base rates are ignored.

**M&A due diligence.** Acquirers develop detailed models of the synergies and strategic fit of a particular deal. The base rate that most acquisitions fail to deliver expected value is treated as not applicable because this deal is different. This is a standard instance of base rate neglect: the specific case overrides the statistical background.

**Startup survival.** Founders building companies routinely project growth trajectories that the base rate for their category doesn't support. Each founder has good reasons to believe their case is different. The base rate persists anyway.

**Project estimation.** Teams estimating project timelines focus on the specific tasks, the team's capabilities, and the project's particulars. The base rate — that projects of this type and complexity routinely take 2x the initial estimate — is typically not applied. (This is part of the planning fallacy mechanism.)

**Investment decisions.** Investors evaluate specific companies based on management quality, market opportunity, and product differentiation. The base rate for investments in their stage, sector, and geography is rarely given the weight it deserves.

**Hiring.** Interviewers form impressions based on specific interactions — answers to questions, communication style, apparent enthusiasm — that override base rate information about which types of candidates succeed in similar roles.

## The Outside View Correction

Kahneman, working with Daniel Lovallo, described the solution as "taking the outside view": deliberately stepping back from the specific case to ask what typically happens in situations of this type.

The outside view process:
1. Identify the reference class: situations that are similar to the current case
2. Find the base rate: what is the actual distribution of outcomes for this reference class?
3. Apply the base rate as the starting point for the forecast
4. Adjust from the base rate based on specific features of the case

The critical insight is that adjustment from the base rate should require justification. The inside-view assessment of the case should modify the base rate only to the extent it provides genuinely new information not captured by the base rate.

This is the reversal of normal practice, which starts from the inside view and adjusts toward the base rate — insufficiently.

## Reference Class Forecasting

Philip Tetlock, Bent Flyvbjerg, and others have developed "reference class forecasting" as a formal discipline for applying base rates to forecasts.

The key steps:
- **Select the reference class**: comparable past projects, decisions, or situations
- **Collect the base rate distribution**: not just the average, but the full distribution of outcomes
- **Position the current case within the distribution**: does the current case have features that make it more or less likely to be in the right tail?
- **Forecast from the distribution, adjusted for the current case**

Reference class forecasting has been shown to significantly improve accuracy for project cost and schedule estimation, infrastructure investment, and strategic planning. The primary barrier to adoption is not analytical difficulty but psychological resistance: the inside view feels more relevant even when the outside view is more accurate.

## Correct Application of Base Rates

Not every base rate is relevant to every case. Applying a base rate requires judgment:

**Is the reference class appropriate?** A base rate for "software projects" may be too broad to be useful. "Mobile consumer apps built by first-time founders in the US" is a more precise reference class.

**Does the specific case have features that legitimately change the probability?** A founder with domain expertise and prior exits may be in a different probability distribution than a first-time founder with no domain knowledge. The question is whether the specific features genuinely discriminate — not just feel like they should.

**Is the base rate actually known?** Some reference classes have good outcome data; others don't. A spurious specific base rate is worse than acknowledging uncertainty.

The goal is not to replace inside-view reasoning with base-rate reasoning, but to start with the base rate and adjust — rather than starting from the inside view and adjusting insufficiently toward the base rate.

## Diagnostic Questions

When making a forecast or estimate:
- What is the reference class for this situation?
- What is the actual historical distribution of outcomes for that reference class?
- Why would this case be different from the base rate — and is that reason specific enough to justify adjustment?
- Am I starting from the case and adjusting toward the base rate (inside-out), or starting from the base rate and adjusting for case specifics (outside-in)?
