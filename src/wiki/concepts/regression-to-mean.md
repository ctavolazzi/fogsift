# Regression to the Mean

*Extraordinary performance tends to be followed by ordinary performance, regardless of whether anything changed.*

## The Principle

Regression to the mean is the statistical tendency for extreme observations to be followed by observations closer to the average — not because of any intervention, but because extreme outcomes are partly produced by chance.

If a process has both systematic and random components, an extreme result reflects an extreme value of both. When you observe again, the systematic component remains but the random component reverts toward average. The extreme result "regresses toward the mean."

Sir Francis Galton identified the phenomenon in the 19th century while studying the heights of children relative to their parents: exceptionally tall parents tended to have children who were tall, but not as tall as the parents; exceptionally short parents had children who were short, but less so. The extremes "regressed" toward the population average.

## Why It Gets Misattributed

Regression to the mean becomes a problem when humans observe the reversion and attribute it to an intervention that happened between the two observations.

A classic sequence:

1. Performance is very bad
2. Intervention is applied (new manager, new training, new process)
3. Performance improves
4. Improvement is attributed to the intervention

But the improvement may be entirely explained by regression to the mean. The extreme bad performance was partly caused by random factors. When observed again, those random factors are less extreme, so performance looks better — regardless of the intervention.

The intervention gets credit it doesn't deserve. The opposite also happens:

1. Performance is very good
2. Intervention is applied (or praised, or rewarded)
3. Performance worsens
4. Worsening is attributed to the intervention or the reward

This is why Daniel Kahneman's famous example involves Israeli Air Force trainers who concluded that praising good landings produced worse subsequent performance while criticizing bad landings produced better performance. The trainers were observing regression to the mean and attributing it to praise and punishment.

## Organizational Examples

**Performance management.** An employee has an exceptional quarter. They're promoted. The next quarter is less exceptional. The promotion looks like it "peaked" the employee, when in fact the first quarter contained positive random elements that weren't sustained.

**Medical interventions.** Patients typically seek treatment when symptoms are worst. After treatment, symptoms often improve — in part because the worst moment has passed and regression operates. Treatments can appear effective even when inert.

**Crisis management consultants.** Consultants are often hired when things are worst. Things subsequently improve. The improvement is attributed to the consultant. Some of it is regression.

**Stock market fund performance.** The top-performing funds in any period contain a significant proportion of luck. In subsequent periods, many regress toward the mean. "Past performance doesn't predict future results" is an acknowledgment of this.

**Sports slumps and hot streaks.** A player in a hot streak is expected to continue. A player in a slump receives coaching. The hot streak cools; the slump ends. Both are partly regression.

## The Diagnostic Question

When you observe exceptional performance followed by correction, ask:

*Could the original extreme result have been partly produced by chance?*

If yes, the subsequent correction may be regression — not evidence that the intervention worked (or failed).

And when you observe bad performance followed by an intervention followed by improvement:

*Would the improvement have happened anyway, without the intervention?*

This requires counterfactual thinking, which is hard. But failing to ask it leads to systematic misjudgment of what causes what.

## How to Account for It

**Use large samples.** A single observation of extreme performance is unreliable. Multiple observations give a better signal. The more observations you have, the better you can separate signal from noise.

**Compare against baselines.** "Performance improved after our intervention" is meaningless without a comparison group that didn't receive the intervention. If the comparison group also improved, regression explains it.

**Look for the mechanism.** If an intervention works, it should work through an identifiable mechanism. Interventions that produce improvement with no plausible mechanism are suspicious.

**Replicate.** One occurrence of improvement is consistent with regression. Repeated, replicated improvement across different situations is harder to explain away as regression.

**Randomized experiments.** The gold standard for disentangling regression from real effects: assign intervention and control randomly, then observe both. Regression affects both groups equally; only the real effect remains.

## The Practical Implication

In consulting and management, regression to the mean has a specific implication: **the timing of an intervention relative to a performance curve matters enormously for how the intervention is perceived.**

Intervene at the bottom of a down cycle: you look brilliant.
Intervene at the top of an up cycle: you look like a jinx.

Neither is real. But the attributions become part of the organizational narrative and shape future decisions.

Understanding regression to the mean is partly about preventing misattribution. It's also about resisting the institutional pressure to "do something" in response to extreme events when the statistically expected outcome is reversion anyway.
