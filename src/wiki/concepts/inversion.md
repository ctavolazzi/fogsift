# Inversion

*Instead of asking how to succeed, ask what would guarantee failure — then avoid those things.*

## The Principle

Inversion is the practice of approaching a problem backwards. Rather than asking "how do we achieve X?" you ask "what would ensure we fail to achieve X?" or "what would the opposite of success look like?" Then you work to avoid those conditions.

The technique has roots in mathematics — many proofs are easier to construct by contradiction than by direct demonstration. Carl Jacobi, the 19th-century German mathematician, applied it to problem-solving generally: "Invert, always invert." Charlie Munger popularized the mental model for business and decision-making.

The insight behind inversion is that the path to success is often more visible when approached from the failure end. Obstacles and failure modes are concrete and specific; success is abstract and elusive. By mapping failure thoroughly, you implicitly map the space you need to navigate around.

## The Basic Method

**Forward thinking:** "How do I build a successful product?"

**Inversion:** "What would guarantee this product fails?"
- Build something nobody wants
- Price it wrong
- Fail to reach the customers who would want it
- Ship it before it works reliably
- Ignore early feedback
- Run out of money before achieving traction

Now: avoid those things. The failure analysis has produced an actionable list of conditions to prevent.

The inverted list often surfaces considerations that forward-thinking misses. Forward planning focuses on activities that might produce success. Inverted planning focuses on failure conditions that, once identified, can be actively countered.

## Where Inversion Has High Leverage

**Risk identification.** "What could go wrong?" is a common but insufficient question because it asks for possibilities without structure. "What sequence of events would guarantee failure?" forces the construction of a causal chain, which produces more specific and actionable risk identification.

**Decision quality.** Before committing to a decision, invert: "If this decision produces the worst possible outcome, what went wrong?" Working backward from the bad outcome often reveals assumptions, dependencies, or risks that were invisible in forward planning.

**Argument and advocacy.** Before presenting an argument, ask what the strongest objections to it are. Anticipating objections by inverting your own position is more rigorous than simply constructing the positive case.

**Organizational culture.** "What does a high-performing culture look like?" is difficult to answer. "What does a systematically dysfunctional culture look like?" is often clearer — and once identified, the dysfunction conditions can be actively countered.

**Strategy.** "What strategic position would leave us most vulnerable?" reveals competitive exposures that forward strategic thinking misses. "If a well-resourced competitor wanted to destroy this business in three years, what would they do?" is a useful inversion exercise.

## Inversion as Pre-Mortem

The pre-mortem method (Gary Klein) is a structured form of inversion: before a project begins, imagine that it is six months in the future and has failed completely. Working backward from that assumed failure, identify what could have caused it.

The pre-mortem is more effective than a standard risk review because:
- The assumed failure frame gives permission to surface concerns that might seem too pessimistic to voice in an optimistic planning context
- It prompts causal reasoning (what led to failure) rather than list-making (possible risks)
- It engages diverse perspectives — different team members often identify different failure causes

Inversion is the underlying logic; the pre-mortem is the specific structured form.

## Failure Modes of Inversion

**Stopping after identification.** Inverting to identify failure conditions is only valuable if those conditions are then actively prevented. "We know what would make this fail" is not the same as "we've structured this to avoid those failures."

**Asymmetric application.** Inversion applied only to proposals you're skeptical of and not to proposals you favor is motivated reasoning, not analysis. Apply it symmetrically — including to your own ideas and preferred approaches.

**Confusing the inverted goal with the actual goal.** Avoiding failure is necessary but not sufficient for achieving success. "We have prevented the known failure modes" is different from "we are on track to succeed." Inversion maps the failure space; it doesn't map the success path.

**Using inversion as a veto mechanism.** In organizations where inversion is used primarily by people who want to block decisions, it becomes a tool for obstruction rather than analysis. The output of inversion should be incorporated into the decision, not used to halt it indefinitely.

## Inversion in Practice

**Organizational decisions:** "What would we have to believe for this decision to be wrong?" applies inversion to scrutinize the assumptions underlying a commitment.

**Hiring:** "What type of person would definitely fail in this role?" often produces a clearer specification than "What type of person would succeed?" Success criteria are often vague; failure criteria are often specific.

**Communication:** "What would make this message misunderstood?" applied to important communications surfaces ambiguities and assumptions that forward drafting misses.

**System design:** "How would this system be abused or fail in production?" — standard in adversarial security thinking — produces more robust design than asking only what the system needs to do correctly.

## Relationship to Other Concepts

**First principles thinking** and inversion are complementary: first principles reasoning constructs from the ground up; inversion approaches from above by asking what the constraints on success actually are.

**Systems thinking** benefits from inversion: "What feedback loops would produce a collapse?" is often more tractable than "What feedback loops would produce flourishing?"

**Pre-mortem** is the organizational form of inversion applied to project planning.

**Constraint mapping** often uses inversion implicitly: constraints are identified by asking what would prevent the goal from being achieved.
