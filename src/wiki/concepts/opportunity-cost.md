# Opportunity Cost

Opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative you give up when making a choice. Every "yes" is an implicit "no" to something else.

## The Principle

> "The cost of a thing is the amount of life you exchange for it." — Henry David Thoreau

Money is the obvious cost. But the real cost of any decision includes everything you can't do because you chose this instead. The meeting you're in has an opportunity cost: whatever you would have done with that hour.

## Why Most People Get This Wrong

### They Only Count Cash

A $50,000 project doesn't cost $50,000. It costs $50,000 *plus* whatever else that money and those people could have produced. If your team could have built a feature worth $200,000 in the same time, the real cost of the project is $250,000.

### They Ignore Sunk Costs

Money already spent is gone. The question isn't "how much have we invested?" It's "given where we are now, what's the best use of our remaining resources?" Pouring more into a failing project because you've already spent a lot is the [sunk cost trap](/wiki/field-notes/008-sunk-cost-trap.html).

### They Forget Time

Time is the ultimate non-renewable resource. An hour spent in a pointless meeting has an opportunity cost that can never be recovered. This is why the most productive people are ruthless about protecting their time.

## How to Think About It

### The Two-List Method

When evaluating a decision, make two lists:

1. **What you gain** from this choice
2. **What you lose** (or can't do) because of this choice

Most people only make the first list. The second list is where the real insight lives.

### The Reversibility Test

**Reversible decisions** have lower opportunity cost. You can change course if the alternative proves better. Make these quickly.

**Irreversible decisions** have higher opportunity cost. Once committed, the alternative is permanently gone. Make these carefully.

### The 10/10/10 Framework

How will you feel about this decision:
- **10 minutes** from now?
- **10 months** from now?
- **10 years** from now?

Short-term and long-term opportunity costs often point in different directions. The framework helps you see both.

## Example: Hiring

You have budget for one engineer. Two candidates:

**Candidate A:** Strong backend developer. Can immediately fix your infrastructure problems.
**Candidate B:** Full-stack generalist. Can build the new feature your biggest client is asking for.

The opportunity cost of hiring A is the client feature (and potentially the client). The opportunity cost of hiring B is the infrastructure stability. Neither cost shows up on the salary line. Both are real.

## In Organizations

Opportunity cost explains most organizational dysfunction:

- **Too many priorities** = each priority gets too little attention, and the opportunity cost of context-switching eats the value
- **Endless meetings** = the opportunity cost in lost deep work exceeds whatever the meetings produce
- **Perfectionism** = the opportunity cost of the 95th percentile of quality is everything else that didn't get done
- **Analysis paralysis** = the opportunity cost of delayed decisions compounds daily

## The Hidden Opportunity Cost of Inaction

Doing nothing is a choice with opportunity costs too. Not hiring, not shipping, not deciding — these all have costs that accumulate invisibly:

- The feature you didn't ship → customers who left
- The person you didn't hire → work that didn't get done
- The process you didn't fix → inefficiency compounding daily

Inaction feels safe because its costs are invisible. But they're often the largest costs of all.

## When to Apply This

You don't need formal opportunity cost analysis for every decision. But check for it when:

- Resources are constrained (they always are)
- You're choosing between multiple good options
- You suspect inertia is driving the decision
- Someone says "we can do both" (you almost never can, fully)
