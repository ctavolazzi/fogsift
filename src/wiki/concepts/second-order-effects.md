# Second-Order Effects

First-order effects are the direct, immediate consequences of an action. Second-order effects are the consequences of those consequences. Most strategic mistakes come from ignoring second-order effects.

## The Concept

When you do something, ask:
1. **First order:** What happens next?
2. **Second order:** And then what?
3. **Third order:** And after that?

Keep going until the effects become negligible or unpredictable.

## Why Second-Order Thinking Matters

### First-Order Thinking is Easy

"If we lower prices, we'll sell more." That's first-order.

"If we lower prices, competitors will respond, margins will shrink across the industry, and we'll need to cut costs, which might affect quality." That's second-order.

The first analysis tells you what you want to hear. The second tells you what will actually happen.

### Most Decisions Stop at First Order

People stop thinking when they reach a satisfying answer. Satisfying doesn't mean correct.

**Example:** "Let's add this feature because users requested it."
- First order: Users get the feature
- Second order: Product complexity increases
- Third order: Support costs rise, other features get delayed
- Fourth order: Core product identity becomes unclear
- Fifth order: You've built a bloated product that satisfies no one well

### Failures Come from Later Orders

The policies that fail spectacularly are usually fine at the first order. It's the second, third, and fourth orders where things break.

## Patterns to Watch

### Compensating Behavior

When you change something, people adjust. Their adjustments often offset your change.

**Example:** Speed bumps to slow traffic
- First order: Cars slow down at the bump
- Second order: Drivers compensate by speeding between bumps
- Third order: Average speed unchanged, but speed variance increases
- Result: Possibly more dangerous than before

### Resource Reallocation

When you add resources in one place, they often come from another place.

**Example:** Hiring more people for a struggling project
- First order: More capacity on this project
- Second order: Other projects lose people or priority
- Third order: Those projects fall behind
- Fourth order: Organization is no better off, just redistributed problems

### Incentive Distortion

When you incentivize something, you get more of it, including gaming the incentive.

**Example:** Bonuses for hitting sales targets
- First order: Sales team pushes harder
- Second order: Sales team games timing (pull forward, push back deals)
- Third order: Customers learn to wait for quarter-end deals
- Fourth order: Consistent sales become impossible; everything bunches at quarter-end
- Fifth order: Revenue becomes unpredictable

### Capability Atrophy

When you solve a problem externally, internal capability to solve it declines.

**Example:** Outsourcing IT
- First order: IT costs decrease
- Second order: Internal IT knowledge erodes
- Third order: Dependence on vendor increases
- Fourth order: Negotiating leverage decreases
- Fifth order: IT costs increase above original level

## How to Think Second-Order

### Ask "And Then What?"

After every consequence you identify, ask what happens next. Don't stop until you've gone at least three levels deep.

### Consider All Stakeholders

Each stakeholder will respond to your action. What do competitors do? What do customers do? What do employees do? What do regulators do?

### Look for Feedback

Will the consequences feed back into the original cause? Will they amplify or dampen the effect?

### Consider Time Horizons

Second-order effects often unfold over longer timescales. A quarterly decision might have annual consequences.

### Invert

Ask: "What would make this fail?" The answer is often a second-order effect you haven't considered.

## Example: Full Analysis

**Decision:** Reduce inventory to cut costs

**First-order effects:**
- Carrying costs decrease
- Cash flow improves

**Second-order effects:**
- Stock-out risk increases
- Suppliers have less buffer for demand spikes
- Purchasing frequency increases

**Third-order effects:**
- Customer complaints about availability
- More frequent supplier negotiations and orders
- Transportation costs increase (smaller, more frequent shipments)

**Fourth-order effects:**
- Customer loyalty decreases
- Supplier relationships strain
- Administrative burden increases

**Fifth-order effects:**
- Revenue decline from lost customers
- Higher procurement costs from damaged supplier relationships
- Need to hire more purchasing staff

**Net assessment:** The first-order cost savings may be completely offset or exceeded by later-order effects. Before deciding, quantify the likely second-order impacts and decide whether the tradeoff is worth it.

## Building the Skill

### Practice on Past Decisions

Take a decision that didn't work out. Trace the causal chain. Where did later-order effects cause the failure?

### Make It Explicit

When proposing decisions, include a "second-order effects" section. Force yourself and others to think beyond the immediate.

### Create Delays

Between proposal and decision, insert time for reflection. Immediate decisions favor first-order thinking.

### Use Devil's Advocates

Assign someone to find the second-order problems with every proposal.
