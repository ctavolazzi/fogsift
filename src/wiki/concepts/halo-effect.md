# The Halo Effect

*Our impression of a person in one domain contaminates our judgment of them in every other domain.*

## The Principle

The halo effect is the tendency for a positive impression in one area to produce positive impressions in other, unrelated areas. And conversely: a negative impression in one area (sometimes called the "horn effect") produces negative impressions across the board.

The effect was named by psychologist Edward Thorndike, who noticed in 1920 that military officers' ratings of their soldiers in one trait (physique, intelligence, leadership) were correlated far more strongly than they should have been if the traits were being evaluated independently. A soldier rated highly for physique was also rated highly for intelligence — not because good-looking soldiers are smarter, but because the overall positive impression leaked across all dimensions.

This isn't a minor distortion. The halo effect makes independent evaluation of separate attributes nearly impossible when the evaluator is also forming an overall impression.

## The Mechanism

When we encounter a person, organization, or product, we form an overall impression rapidly and often unconsciously. Subsequent evaluations of specific attributes are then influenced by that overall impression.

The mechanism is partly attentional: we look for information that confirms the overall impression and discount information that contradicts it. It's partly constructive: when we don't have direct evidence about an attribute, we fill in from our overall impression. And it's partly motivated: coherent overall impressions are satisfying, so we resist information that disrupts coherence.

The result is that our judgments of specific attributes are not independent — they're systematically biased by the overall impression, which itself is often formed from a small number of initial signals.

## Where It Operates

**Performance evaluations.** An employee who excels at one highly visible task (or who made a strong early impression) tends to receive higher ratings across all dimensions. The rater isn't consciously inflating scores — the positive impression has genuinely changed how they perceive the employee's performance on unrelated dimensions.

**Hiring.** Attractive candidates are rated more favorably on intelligence, interpersonal skills, and work ethic. Candidates from prestigious universities or companies carry a halo from the institution that inflates assessments of their individual capabilities.

**Leadership perception.** When companies perform well, CEOs are described as visionary, decisive, and analytically gifted. When the same decisions lead to poor performance, the same CEOs are described as reckless, autocratic, and out of touch. The halo of company performance shapes attribution of leader quality.

**Product and brand evaluations.** Apple's design reputation creates a halo that influences how consumers evaluate Apple products' reliability, customer service, and value — independent of actual performance on those dimensions. The brand impression contaminates specific attribute assessment.

**Investment and funding decisions.** Founders from prestigious backgrounds, with charismatic presentation skills, or who have prior successful exits carry a halo that distorts evaluation of their current business fundamentals. The "hot founder" phenomenon is partly a halo effect.

**Customer satisfaction research.** Survey respondents who are happy with a company overall rate specific attributes more favorably than those attributes would merit on their own. Overall satisfaction contaminates specific satisfaction ratings.

## The Sequence Problem

The halo effect is highly sensitive to sequence. The first attribute observed or learned about has outsized influence on subsequent evaluations.

This is why:
- First impressions are disproportionately important
- The order in which information is presented in a pitch or interview affects its evaluation
- The first thing you read about a company shapes how you interpret everything you subsequently read
- A strong opening to a presentation can make later weaker sections seem stronger than they are

The practical implication: when designing evaluations, reviews, or research instruments, the sequence of information presented significantly affects the results.

## The Halo Effect in Organizational Narrative

One of the most important applications is in how organizations construct their own histories. When a company is performing well, its past decisions are reconstructed as smart and prescient. When it's performing poorly, the same past decisions are reconstructed as flawed and shortsighted.

Phil Rosenzweig called this "the halo effect in business" — the way business narratives attribute company performance to leadership quality, strategy, and culture, when in fact company performance is largely driven by factors external to the company. The halo of performance retrospectively makes strategies look brilliant; the gloom of underperformance makes the same strategies look misguided.

This has significant implications for learning from organizational experience: post-hoc narrative accounts of success and failure are heavily distorted by the halo of outcomes.

## Countermeasures

**Evaluate attributes independently.** In structured evaluations (performance reviews, interview scoring), assess each attribute separately and completely before moving to the next. Don't form an overall impression and then fill in attribute scores.

**Blind evaluation where possible.** Remove identifying information that triggers halos — names, schools, previous employers — when the evaluation should focus on the work itself. Code reviews, academic peer review, and audition-based hiring all reduce halo contamination.

**Disaggregate the question.** Instead of "Is this a good candidate?" ask separately: "What is their analytical skill?" "What is their communication quality?" "What is their relevant experience?" Force independent assessment of separate dimensions.

**Be alert to sequence effects.** Notice when you're forming an overall impression before you have sufficient specific information. The strength of an initial impression should be proportional to how much evidence it's based on — not to how vivid the first signal was.

**Attribute outcomes to factors, not people.** When learning from organizational experience, explicitly separate what the company or leader controlled from what was driven by market, competitor, and macro factors. This reduces the contamination of outcome-based halos.

**Weighted scorecards.** For high-stakes decisions, define evaluation criteria and their weights in advance of the evaluation. Apply scores to criteria independently and compute weighted totals rather than forming holistic impressions.
