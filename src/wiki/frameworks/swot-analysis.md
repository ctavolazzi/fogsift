# SWOT Analysis

SWOT is a strategic planning framework that evaluates a situation through four lenses: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. Simple enough for a napkin, structured enough for a boardroom.

## The Framework

| | **Helpful** | **Harmful** |
|---|---|---|
| **Internal** | Strengths | Weaknesses |
| **External** | Opportunities | Threats |

Two axes. Four quadrants. That's it.

**Internal factors** are things you control: skills, resources, processes, culture.
**External factors** are things you don't: market conditions, competitors, regulations, technology shifts.

## Why It Works

SWOT forces completeness. Most analysis focuses on either problems (what's wrong) or opportunities (what's possible). SWOT makes you look at all four quadrants. The power isn't in any single quadrant — it's in the intersections.

## How to Do It Right

### Strengths

What do you do better than anyone else? What resources do you have that others don't? What do outsiders see as your advantage?

**Good strength statements are:**
- Specific: "3 engineers with ML experience" not "strong team"
- Comparative: "Faster deployment cycle than competitors" not "good at deploying"
- Honest: Only include real advantages, not aspirational ones

### Weaknesses

Where do you underperform? What do you lack? What do competitors do better?

**This is where most SWOTs fail.** Teams aren't honest about weaknesses. The exercise only works if you are.

- "We don't have a designer" is useful
- "We could improve our design" is evasion
- "Our onboarding takes 3 weeks vs. industry standard of 3 days" is actionable

### Opportunities

What market trends favor you? What needs are underserved? What changes create openings?

Look for opportunities at the intersection of external changes and internal strengths. A market shift means nothing if you can't capitalize on it.

### Threats

What external factors could hurt you? What are competitors planning? What assumptions could break?

**Distinguish between:**
- **Probable threats:** Things likely to happen (competitor launching similar product)
- **Possible threats:** Things that could happen (regulation change)
- **Existential threats:** Things that would end you (market disappearing)

## The Real Value: Cross-Quadrant Strategies

The four quadrants generate four strategy types:

### S-O Strategies (Strengths + Opportunities)
Use your strengths to capture opportunities. This is your attack plan.

*Example: "We have deep technical expertise (S) and the market is shifting toward technical solutions (O). Strategy: Position as the technical leader in this space."*

### W-O Strategies (Weaknesses + Opportunities)
Address weaknesses to capture opportunities. This is your investment plan.

*Example: "We lack marketing capabilities (W) but there's a growing market (O). Strategy: Hire a marketing lead or partner with a marketing firm."*

### S-T Strategies (Strengths + Threats)
Use strengths to defend against threats. This is your defense plan.

*Example: "We have strong customer relationships (S) and a new competitor is entering (T). Strategy: Deepen customer engagement to increase switching costs."*

### W-T Strategies (Weaknesses + Threats)
Address weaknesses to avoid threats. This is your survival plan.

*Example: "Our technology is aging (W) and the market is moving to new platforms (T). Strategy: Invest in modernization now before it becomes urgent."*

## Common Pitfalls

### Too Vague
"Good team" and "competitive market" aren't useful. Be specific enough that someone could take action based on each item.

### Too Long
If you have 30 items per quadrant, you haven't prioritized. Aim for 3-7 per quadrant, ranked by importance.

### One and Done
SWOT isn't a document — it's a conversation. The value is in the discussion, and it needs to be revisited as conditions change.

### Ignoring Interactions
A strength in isolation is just a fact. A strength paired with an opportunity is a strategy. Always work the intersections.

### Confusing Internal and External
"Competitors are ahead of us" feels like a weakness, but it's a threat (external). Your weakness is whatever internal factor allows them to be ahead. The distinction matters because you can fix internal factors.

## When to Use This

- Starting a new project or initiative
- Evaluating a strategic decision
- Annual planning or quarterly reviews
- Entering a new market
- Responding to a competitive move

## When NOT to Use This

- For operational problems (use [Root Cause Analysis](/wiki/concepts/root-cause.html))
- When you need quantitative rigor (use [Decision Matrix](/wiki/frameworks/decision-matrix.html))
- As a substitute for actual research (SWOT organizes knowledge — it doesn't create it)
