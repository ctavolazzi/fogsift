# Prioritization Matrix

A prioritization matrix helps you decide what to do first, what to do later, and what to not do at all. When everything feels urgent, the matrix reveals what actually matters.

## The Eisenhower Matrix

The most famous prioritization framework. Two axes: urgency and importance.

| | **Urgent** | **Not Urgent** |
|---|---|---|
| **Important** | **DO** — Crisis, deadlines, critical bugs | **PLAN** — Strategy, prevention, skill-building |
| **Not Important** | **DELEGATE** — Interruptions, some meetings, most emails | **DROP** — Time-wasters, busywork, most notifications |

### The Insight Most People Miss

Quadrant 2 (Important + Not Urgent) is where the real value lives. This is where you:
- Build systems that prevent crises
- Develop skills that make you more effective
- Strengthen relationships before you need favors
- Fix processes before they break

But Quadrant 1 (Important + Urgent) always screams louder. The discipline of prioritization is spending time in Q2 to shrink Q1.

## Impact/Effort Matrix

When you have a backlog of options and need to decide which to tackle first.

| | **Low Effort** | **High Effort** |
|---|---|---|
| **High Impact** | **Quick Wins** — Do these first | **Major Projects** — Plan and commit |
| **Low Impact** | **Fill-ins** — Do if time allows | **Money Pits** — Avoid |

### How to Score Impact

Impact means different things in different contexts. Pick the metric that matters:
- Revenue generated or protected
- Time saved (across how many people?)
- Risk reduced
- Customer satisfaction improved
- Strategic position strengthened

### How to Score Effort

Effort includes everything, not just hours:
- Time to complete
- Number of people involved
- Technical complexity
- Organizational complexity (approvals, coordination)
- Opportunity cost of those resources

## RICE Framework

A more quantitative approach, popular in product management.

**R**each — How many people/units will this affect in a given time period?
**I**mpact — How much will it affect each person? (0.25 = minimal, 0.5 = low, 1 = medium, 2 = high, 3 = massive)
**C**onfidence — How sure are you about these estimates? (100% = high, 80% = medium, 50% = low)
**E**ffort — How many person-months will this take?

**RICE Score = (Reach x Impact x Confidence) / Effort**

### Example

| Feature | Reach | Impact | Confidence | Effort | RICE Score |
|---------|-------|--------|------------|--------|------------|
| Search | 5,000/mo | 2 | 80% | 2 mo | 4,000 |
| Dark mode | 3,000/mo | 1 | 90% | 0.5 mo | 5,400 |
| API v2 | 200/mo | 3 | 60% | 4 mo | 90 |

Dark mode wins despite being "less important" because it's fast to build and affects many users with high confidence. API v2 scores low because it's expensive, affects few users, and the estimates are uncertain.

## MoSCoW Method

For scope management when you can't do everything.

- **Must have** — The system doesn't work without these. Non-negotiable.
- **Should have** — Important but the system works without them. Strong desire.
- **Could have** — Nice to have. Include if time and budget allow.
- **Won't have** (this time) — Explicitly out of scope. Maybe later.

### The Key Discipline

The "Won't have" category is where MoSCoW earns its keep. Explicitly naming what you're NOT doing is more powerful than listing what you are doing. It prevents scope creep and sets clear expectations.

## Choosing the Right Framework

| Situation | Framework |
|-----------|-----------|
| Personal productivity | Eisenhower Matrix |
| Product backlog | RICE or Impact/Effort |
| Project scoping | MoSCoW |
| Strategic planning | Impact/Effort with longer time horizons |
| Quick team alignment | Eisenhower or Impact/Effort on a whiteboard |

## Common Pitfalls

### Everything Is "High Priority"

If everything is priority one, nothing is. Force-rank. If you have 20 items, number them 1-20. No ties. The pain of ranking is the point — it forces real decisions.

### Confusing Urgency with Importance

Urgent things demand attention. Important things produce results. They're not the same. A ringing phone is urgent. Learning a new skill is important. Most people spend their day on urgent-but-not-important tasks.

### Prioritizing Once

Priorities change. New information arrives. Resources shift. Re-prioritize regularly — weekly for tactical, monthly for strategic.

### Ignoring Dependencies

Item #3 might depend on Item #7. The priority isn't just about value — it's about sequence. Map dependencies before finalizing the order.

### Not Communicating Priorities

A priority list that only exists in your head isn't a priority list. It's a wish. Write it down. Share it. Get buy-in. Update it publicly.
