# Stakeholder Mapping

Stakeholder mapping is the systematic process of identifying everyone affected by or capable of affecting a project, decision, or change — then organizing them by their influence and interest so you can manage the relationship appropriately.

Without a map, organizations routinely overlook critical stakeholders, over-invest in the wrong relationships, and encounter resistance that was predictable but unseen.

## The Core Matrix

The standard framework plots stakeholders on a 2x2 grid:

```
High    |  Keep Satisfied  |  Manage Closely   |
Power   |                  |                   |
        +------------------+-------------------+
Low     |  Monitor         |  Keep Informed    |
Power   |  (minimal)       |                   |
        +------------------+-------------------+
              Low Interest      High Interest
```

**Manage Closely (High Power / High Interest)**
These stakeholders have both the ability to influence the outcome and strong motivation to do so. They require active engagement — regular communication, involvement in decisions, genuine responsiveness to their concerns. Ignoring them is the most common cause of project derailment.

**Keep Satisfied (High Power / Low Interest)**
These stakeholders have significant influence but aren't deeply invested in your project right now. The risk is that something could activate their interest — and if they engage negatively because they feel uninformed, they can become blockers. Keep them informed at appropriate intervals without burdening them with detail.

**Keep Informed (Low Power / High Interest)**
These stakeholders care about what you're doing but have limited ability to affect it. They're often the end users, frontline workers, or affected communities. Neglecting them creates morale problems and surfaces as "resistance" during implementation. They often surface information that high-power stakeholders miss.

**Monitor (Low Power / Low Interest)**
These stakeholders require minimal active management. Track whether their position changes.

## Beyond Power and Interest

The 2x2 is a starting point, not the complete picture. Additional dimensions:

**Attitude** (Supportive / Neutral / Opposed): A high-power supporter is different from a high-power opponent, even if both are "manage closely" by grid placement.

**Legitimacy**: Some stakeholders have formal authority; others have informal influence. Both matter. The IT manager who controls key infrastructure and the respected long-tenured employee who can shift team opinion need different strategies.

**Urgency**: How pressing are their concerns? A stakeholder who needs information urgently but is deprioritized becomes a source of escalations.

**Coalitions**: Stakeholders don't act independently. Who influences whom? Map the informal influence network, not just the formal org chart.

## The Mapping Process

### Step 1: Brainstorm Comprehensively

Generate a wide initial list. Include:
- Formal decision-makers and approvers
- People who implement or are affected by the outcome
- External parties (regulators, customers, vendors, community)
- People who control resources you need
- People who will be asked for their opinion
- People who could block progress, even informally

The most common mapping failure is not listing someone until they become a problem.

### Step 2: Assess Position on the Grid

For each stakeholder, estimate:
- **Power**: What is their actual ability to affect the outcome? (Not their formal rank — informal influence counts.)
- **Interest**: How much do they care about this specific project?
- **Attitude**: Are they likely to support, oppose, or remain neutral?

---

### Step 3: Identify the Gaps

Who is in "Manage Closely" that you haven't been managing closely? Who has shifted from low to high interest as the project evolved? Who is missing from your list entirely?

This step often reveals that the actual engagement plan is misaligned with the stakeholder landscape.

---

### Step 4: Define Engagement Strategy

For each cluster, define:
- **Communication frequency and format**: Weekly briefing vs. monthly update vs. exception-only
- **Channel**: One-on-one vs. group meeting vs. written update
- **Content**: Level of detail, framing, what you're asking of them
- **Who engages**: Who is the right person from your team to communicate with each stakeholder?

---

### Step 5: Track and Update

Stakeholder positions change. A neutral party becomes opposed when they understand the implications. A supporter loses interest. A new person takes a key role. The map should be revisited at project milestones and whenever significant changes occur.

A static stakeholder map is quickly outdated and false confidence.

## Common Failure Modes

**Skipping opponents.** The natural tendency is to focus on supporters. Opponents need more attention, not less — their concerns should be understood, and either addressed or explicitly accepted as acceptable costs.

**Confusing formal rank with actual power.** The CFO is formally high-power, but in a specific technical initiative, the lead architect may have more practical influence. Map actual influence, not org chart position.

**Treating stakeholders as monolithic.** "Sales leadership" isn't a stakeholder — individual people are. A VP of Sales in favor and a Director of Sales strongly opposed need different approaches.

**One-and-done mapping.** Initial maps are hypotheses. Revise them when you learn more.

**Using the map only for communications, not for decisions.** The map should inform what decisions get made, what options are considered, and what trade-offs are acceptable — not just who to email.

## Relationship to Other Frameworks

**Force field analysis** can be applied to the stakeholder landscape: which stakeholders are driving forces for the change? Which are restraining forces? The interaction between these groups determines the feasibility of the initiative.

**Pre-mortem**: Stakeholder analysis surfaces which groups might cause failure. Their concerns should be stress-tested in a pre-mortem, not just noted.

**Risk assessment**: Unsatisfied high-power opponents are a risk that should be in your risk register with mitigation plans.
