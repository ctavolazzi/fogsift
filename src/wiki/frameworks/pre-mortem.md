# Pre-Mortem Analysis

A pre-mortem is a prospective failure analysis: before a project launches, you imagine it has already failed — then work backward to figure out why.

It's one of the most underused tools in decision-making. It takes 30 minutes and regularly surfaces risks that months of planning missed.

---

## The Core Idea

Traditional risk analysis asks: *What could go wrong?* This tends to produce short, optimistic lists. The social dynamics of planning favor confidence over candor.

The pre-mortem reframes the question: *It's a year from now. This project failed badly. What happened?*

This works because:

1. **Future-perfect framing reduces defensiveness.** You're not predicting failure — you're explaining a failure that has already (hypothetically) occurred. The emotional stakes drop.
2. **"Prospective hindsight" surfaces concrete failures.** Research by psychologist Gary Klein, who developed the technique, shows that imagining a specific outcome as having already happened increases the ability to identify reasons by 30%.
3. **It creates psychological safety for skeptics.** People who see risks but feel pressure to stay positive now have formal permission — even an obligation — to surface concerns.

## When to Use It

- Before launching a major initiative or project
- Before making a significant hire
- Before signing a key contract or partnership
- Before a product launch or public commitment
- Any time you're about to cross a point of no return

## The Process

### Step 1: Set the Scene (2 minutes)

Gather the project team. State clearly:

*"Assume it is [date 6-12 months from now]. This project has failed — significantly, embarrassingly, in a way that's hard to recover from. We're going to figure out why."*

The specific, named failure matters. "Things didn't work out" is too abstract. You want people imagining real consequences: missed revenue, public embarrassment, team departures, product recalls.

---

### Step 2: Individual Silent Writing (5-10 minutes)

Each person writes down every reason they can think of for the failure. Alone. Silently.

This step is non-negotiable. Without it, the first few voices anchor the group's thinking and suppress minority views. The goal is to generate the full range of concerns, not just the loudest ones.

Prompt: *"In the space below, write every reason you can think of why this project failed. Nothing is too small, too political, or too obvious."*

---

### Step 3: Round-Robin Sharing (10-15 minutes)

Go around the room. Each person shares **one item** from their list. No discussion yet — just collection.

Continue rotating until the list is exhausted. Record everything publicly (whiteboard, shared doc).

Rules:
- No dismissing items ("that won't happen")
- No defending the plan ("but we've already thought of that")
- Duplicates are fine — they reveal which risks feel most salient

---

### Step 4: Cluster and Prioritize (10 minutes)

Group the items by theme. Look for:
- Items that appeared on multiple lists (high salience)
- Items that represent irreversible failures vs. recoverable setbacks
- Items that no one on the team is currently responsible for preventing

Don't try to solve everything. Focus on the **top 3-5 risks** that would be both likely and catastrophic.

---

### Step 5: Assign Ownership

For each high-priority risk:
- Who is responsible for monitoring this?
- What would we see if this was starting to happen?
- What pre-emptive action reduces the probability?

The pre-mortem is only useful if it changes behavior before the failure. Without assigned owners, it becomes a ritual rather than a tool.

---

## Variations

**The "pre-parade":** After the pre-mortem, do a brief pre-parade — imagine the project succeeded beyond all expectations. What made it work? This surfaces hidden opportunities alongside hidden risks.

**Asynchronous version:** Send the prompt in writing 24 hours before the meeting. People submit their lists beforehand. The meeting becomes a synthesis session rather than a generation session.

**Solo pre-mortem:** For individual decisions (job change, major purchase, partnership), sit alone and write for 10 minutes as if the decision went badly. What would you wish you'd thought of?

---

## Common Failure Modes

**Going through the motions.** The pre-mortem generates a list, the list gets filed, nothing changes. The tool requires follow-through.

**Stopping at obvious risks.** "Scope creep" and "communication breakdown" are real but they're also safe answers. Dig past them: *What specifically would cause scope creep? Who would allow it? Why?*

**Treating it as pessimism.** The pre-mortem isn't about expecting failure — it's about taking the plan seriously enough to stress-test it. The strongest teams run the hardest pre-mortems.

**Skipping the silent writing step.** Group dynamics will dominate if you go straight to discussion. The individual writing step is the mechanism that makes the technique work.

---

## The Underlying Logic

The pre-mortem isn't magic — it's a structured way of overcoming optimism bias and social conformity pressure in group planning.

Most plans fail in predictable ways: overestimated resources, underestimated complexity, unexamined dependencies, unaddressed interpersonal friction. The pre-mortem doesn't prevent these failures — it surfaces the ones that are visible to the room but unsaid, and creates accountability for addressing them.

The failures you couldn't have anticipated are, by definition, unavoidable. The failures you could have anticipated but didn't say out loud — those are the ones the pre-mortem catches.
