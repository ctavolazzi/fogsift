# Force Field Analysis

Force field analysis is a decision-making framework for understanding the forces that support and oppose a proposed change. Developed by psychologist Kurt Lewin, it provides a structured way to see why change is resisting — and how to make it more likely to succeed.

The core insight: any equilibrium (a current state) is maintained by a balance of driving forces (pushing toward change) and restraining forces (pushing against it). To shift the equilibrium, you either strengthen the drivers, weaken the restrainers, or both.

## The Basic Model

```
Current State ← Restraining Forces
Current State → Driving Forces

If Drivers > Restrainers: change occurs
If Restrainers > Drivers: status quo holds
If balanced: current state is stable
```

Most change initiatives fail not because they lack advocates, but because they focus exclusively on adding more driving force — more arguments, more mandates, more incentives — without addressing the restraining forces. This increases tension in the system without moving the equilibrium.

## When To Use It

- Before launching a major initiative or organizational change
- When a project is stalled and you need to diagnose why
- When resistance to a proposal is strong and poorly understood
- When multiple stakeholders have different views on whether to proceed
- When deciding between "push harder" vs. "remove obstacles" strategies

## The Process

### Step 1: Define the Proposed Change

State the change clearly and specifically. Not "improve our culture" but "implement a 30-minute weekly one-on-one meeting between managers and direct reports."

Specificity matters. Vague changes produce vague force maps.

---

### Step 2: Identify Driving Forces

Driving forces are the factors supporting the change. List them:

- What problem does this solve?
- Who benefits, and how?
- What external pressures push toward this change?
- What internal motivations support it?
- What precedents or trends favor it?

For each force, assess strength: strong, moderate, or weak.

---

### Step 3: Identify Restraining Forces

Restraining forces are the factors opposing the change. List them:

- What is at risk if this change happens?
- Who loses status, comfort, or resources?
- What habits or norms does this challenge?
- What are the legitimate concerns about this change?
- What would have to be given up for this to succeed?

Include legitimate concerns alongside illegitimate ones — the distinction matters for strategy, but both are real forces.

For each force, assess strength: strong, moderate, or weak.

### Step 4: Draw the Analysis

Represent forces visually — arrows pointing toward a center line (the current state):

```
DRIVING FORCES              |              RESTRAINING FORCES
                            |
→→→→ Management mandate     |   Cost/budget risk ←←
                            |
→→ Customer demand          |   Staff uncertainty ←←←←
                            |
→ Process efficiency gain   |   Vendor dependency ←←←
                            |
```

Arrow length represents strength. This makes the balance visible at a glance.

### Step 5: Determine Strategy

The force map suggests four types of action:

**Strengthen strong drivers** — amplify forces already working in your favor.

**Add new drivers** — identify incentives, arguments, or evidence that could add weight.

**Weaken strong restrainers** — address the most significant sources of resistance directly. This is usually the highest-leverage action.

**Remove restrainers** — some restrainers can be eliminated entirely (a policy changed, a resource provided, a concern addressed by design modification).

**Lewin's key finding:** reducing restraining forces is often more effective than adding driving forces. Increased driving forces increase tension, which increases resistance. Removing restrainers allows movement with less overall conflict.

---

## Example: Adopting a New Project Management Tool

**Driving forces:**
- Current tool missing key features (strong)
- Leadership mandate to improve visibility (moderate)
- Several team members have experience with the new tool (weak)

**Restraining forces:**
- Learning curve during a busy period (strong)
- Data migration risk (moderate)
- Team skepticism about "yet another new tool" (strong)
- Licensing cost (weak)

**Strategy implications:**
The strong restrainers (learning curve timing and skepticism) suggest:
- Don't increase mandate pressure — this will increase resistance
- Address the timing: delay rollout to a quieter period
- Address the skepticism: involve skeptics in tool selection and piloting
- Prepare a migration plan to address data risk before launch

Applying more management pressure (adding a driving force) without addressing timing and skepticism would increase tension without moving the equilibrium.

## Common Failure Modes

**Listing driving forces as restraining forces.** "Lack of training" is not a restraining force — training is a driver that's absent. The restraining force is "fear of competence loss" or "investment required for training." Get the framing right.

**Ignoring legitimate concerns.** Restraining forces include valid objections. If the change genuinely has flaws, those concerns aren't just "resistance to manage" — they're feedback to incorporate.

**Skipping the strength assessment.** All forces are not equal. A force map without strength indicators gives a misleading picture of the actual balance.

**Planning to push through resistance.** Force field analysis often reveals that the right move is a modified version of the change, implemented differently, not a harder push on an unchanged plan.

---

## Relationship to Other Frameworks

**Pre-mortem** adds prospective failure scenarios to the restraining force analysis — what specifically would cause this to fail?

**Risk assessment** complements the restraining force analysis with probability and impact estimates.

**Stakeholder mapping** provides the human dimension: which restraining forces are concentrated in which individuals or groups?
