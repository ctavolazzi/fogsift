# The TRACE Protocol

TRACE is our systematic approach to diagnostic investigation. It provides structure without being prescriptive, ensuring thorough investigation while remaining adaptable to different problem types.

## The Framework

### T - Target the Symptom

Before you can solve a problem, you need to define it precisely.

**Questions to answer:**
- What exactly is happening?
- What should be happening instead?
- What is the gap between current and desired state?
- How do we measure the symptom?

**Common mistakes:**
- Defining the problem too broadly ("things are broken")
- Defining the symptom as a cause ("we have a training problem")
- Accepting someone else's problem definition without verification

**Output:** A clear, measurable symptom statement.

### R - Record the Evidence

Systematic evidence collection prevents confirmation bias and ensures you don't miss important data.

**Evidence types:**
- **Documentary:** Emails, reports, logs, metrics, procedures
- **Testimonial:** Interviews, observations, firsthand accounts
- **Physical:** Site observations, artifact inspection
- **Temporal:** Timelines, sequences, patterns over time

**Recording principles:**
- Capture everything, filter later
- Note sources and dates
- Distinguish fact from interpretation
- Preserve original context

**Output:** Organized evidence repository with clear sourcing.

### A - Analyze the Chain

Map the causal chain from symptom to source.

**Process:**
1. Start with the symptom
2. Ask "what directly caused this?"
3. Document the cause
4. Repeat until you reach a point where intervention is possible

**Tools:**
- [Five Whys](/wiki/tools/five-whys.html)
- [Fishbone Diagrams](/wiki/tools/fishbone-diagram.html)
- Causal chain mapping
- Timeline analysis

**Warning signs you've stopped too early:**
- The cause is a person ("John made an error")
- The cause is vague ("communication breakdown")
- You can't explain *why* this cause occurred

**Output:** Visual causal chain from symptom to root cause.

### C - Challenge Assumptions

Every investigation is built on assumptions. Some are valid. Some aren't.

**Questions to ask:**
- What are we assuming to be true without evidence?
- What if the opposite were true?
- Whose perspective are we missing?
- What evidence would contradict our current hypothesis?

**Common hidden assumptions:**
- "The process is being followed as documented"
- "The people involved are telling us everything"
- "The metric we're measuring reflects the real problem"
- "Past performance predicts future behavior"

**Output:** List of validated and invalidated assumptions.

---

### E - Expose the Root

The root cause is the deepest point in the causal chain where intervention is both possible and effective.

**Root cause criteria:**
- Removing it prevents recurrence
- It's within the organization's control
- Addressing it is proportional to the problem
- The evidence supports it

**Validation tests:**
- If this was the root cause, would this symptom have occurred? (Yes)
- If we eliminate this cause, will the symptom recur? (No)
- Can we trace the causal chain from this cause to the symptom? (Yes)
- Is there a deeper cause we haven't explored? (No)

**Output:** Documented root cause with supporting evidence.

## Putting It Together

TRACE is iterative. You'll often cycle back through earlier phases as new information emerges:

1. **Start:** Target the symptom
2. **Gather:** Record initial evidence
3. **Map:** Begin analyzing the chain
4. **Test:** Challenge emerging hypotheses
5. **Refine:** Return to evidence gathering with new questions
6. **Converge:** Expose the root when evidence supports it

## When to Use TRACE

- Complex problems with unclear causes
- Recurring problems that resist simple fixes
- High-stakes situations where being wrong is costly
- Situations where multiple stakeholders have different explanations

## When TRACE is Overkill

- Simple problems with obvious causes
- Situations where speed matters more than certainty
- Problems where the solution is known and implementation is the challenge

*TRACE provides structure, not a script. Adapt it to your context.*
