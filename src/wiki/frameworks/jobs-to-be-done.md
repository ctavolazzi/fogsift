# Jobs To Be Done

Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) is a framework for understanding what people are actually trying to accomplish when they use a product, service, or process — and why they "hire" one solution over alternatives.

The core insight: people don't buy products; they hire them to do a job. The job is the fundamental unit of analysis, not the product, the customer segment, or the feature.

## The Foundational Idea

Clayton Christensen, who developed the framework with colleagues including Bob Moesta, used the milkshake example to illustrate the concept. A fast-food chain wanted to improve milkshake sales. Traditional market research segmented customers by demographics, asked what would make milkshakes better, and yielded suggestions that didn't improve sales.

Christensen's team instead asked: what job are people hiring milkshakes to do? They found two distinct jobs: morning commuters hired milkshakes to keep them occupied during a long commute and stave off hunger until lunch. The job required something that lasted, fit in a cupholder, and required no mess. Afternoon purchasers hired milkshakes as a treat for children. Completely different jobs — in competition with completely different alternatives.

Improving the milkshake for the commuter (more viscous, easier straw) was a different task from improving it for the treat-buyer (smaller size, faster). One product, two jobs, two entirely different improvement strategies.

## Jobs Are Not Features or Benefits

The mistake in most product and service development is conflating the job with the features used to do the job, or with the benefits customers claim to want.

- **Features** are the attributes of a solution. They're not the job.
- **Benefits** are what customers say they want. They often describe the solution, not the underlying progress they're trying to make.
- **The job** is the progress a person is trying to make in a particular circumstance.

The job is stable even as solutions change. Before cars, people hired horses for transportation. Before spreadsheets, people hired accountants for financial modeling. The job persisted; the hired solution changed.

## Three Dimensions of a Job

**Functional.** The practical task: get from A to B, file my taxes, ship this project.

**Social.** How the person wants to be perceived by others: appear competent, signal status, demonstrate care.

**Emotional.** How the person wants to feel: confident, in control, calm, accomplished.

Products that address only the functional dimension often lose to products that also address the social and emotional dimensions. People hire solutions that help them make all three types of progress simultaneously.

## The Circumstances Matter

"What is the job?" is incomplete without the circumstances. The same functional outcome can constitute different jobs depending on context.

A person hiring a coffee shop "to get work done in a quiet environment" has a different job than a person hiring a coffee shop "to have a meeting with a colleague" — even though both are in coffee shops and both may order coffee.

The JTBD framework makes circumstances explicit: "When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome]."

This specificity is what distinguishes JTBD from generic needs statements. "People want convenience" is not a job. "When I'm cooking dinner and realize I'm out of an ingredient, I want to get a replacement quickly with minimal disruption, so the meal can continue" is a job — and it reveals why a nearby convenience store is often hired over a distant supermarket even when the supermarket is cheaper.

---

## Competitive Landscape

One of JTBD's most valuable outputs is a redefined view of competition. Products don't compete against other products in the same category — they compete against everything customers might hire to do the same job.

A project management tool competes not just against other project management tools, but against spreadsheets, email threads, status meetings, and the alternative of having fewer projects. Uber competed not against other rideshare companies but against taxis, car rentals, public transit, and in some cases just not going.

The JTBD lens often reveals competition that traditional category-based analysis misses — and substitution risks that would otherwise be invisible.

## Forces That Drive Switching

Moesta's research identified four forces that determine whether someone switches from their current solution to a new one:

**Push forces** — frustrations with the current solution that push people toward change:
- Friction in current usage
- Features not working as expected
- Cost concerns

**Pull forces** — attractions of the new solution that pull people toward it:
- Promises of improvement
- The job being done better

**Anxiety forces** — fears about switching:
- Will the new solution actually work?
- Will I lose something I rely on?
- Is switching worth the disruption?

**Habit forces** — attachment to the current way of doing things:
- "Good enough" inertia
- Comfort with familiar processes
- Switching costs

For a switch to happen, the push and pull forces must overcome the anxiety and habit forces. Most solutions focus on building pull (better features) without addressing anxiety and habit — which is why adoption rates often underperform expectations even when products are objectively better.

## Applying the Framework

### Step 1: Identify the Job

Interview people immediately after a purchase or usage decision. Focus on:
- What were you trying to accomplish?
- What were you doing before you hired this?
- What was happening in your life that made you look for a solution?
- Walk me through the day you first tried this.

Listen for the circumstances, not just the stated need. The circumstances reveal the job.

### Step 2: Map the Forces

For each customer type, map the push, pull, anxiety, and habit forces. Where do anxiety and habit forces dominate? Those are the points that must be addressed — not just with product features, but with trust-building, onboarding design, and migration support.

### Step 3: Identify Competing Hires

What else could people hire to do this job? The answer is often surprising and almost always reveals threat or opportunity that category-level competitive analysis misses.

### Step 4: Design to the Job

Once the job is well-specified, evaluate features, messaging, and onboarding against whether they help customers do the job — not against whether they match competitor features or sound appealing in the abstract.

## Common Failure Modes

**Describing the solution, not the job.** "Our customers want a better dashboard" is not a job. It describes a feature. The job is what the dashboard helps them accomplish.

**Over-segmenting by demographics.** Demographics correlate with jobs but don't cause them. Two people with identical demographics may have opposite jobs in the same product context.

**Confusing tasks with jobs.** A task is a step in doing a job. "Upload the document" is a task. "Collaborate on the draft before the deadline" might be the job. Optimizing tasks without understanding jobs improves efficiency but may miss the actual problem.

**Ignoring non-consumption.** For many jobs, the real competitor is inaction — people choosing not to hire anything to do the job. Products that only compete against alternatives ignore the option to do nothing, which is often the most common current state.

## Relationship to Other Frameworks

**Pre-mortem** can be applied to JTBD adoption: if users fail to adopt, what job did we get wrong? What anxiety force did we underestimate?

**Force field analysis** maps directly to the four forces: push and pull vs. anxiety and habit.

**Constraint mapping** can identify which job constraint is binding — if a job fails to be done, what specific friction or barrier was decisive?
