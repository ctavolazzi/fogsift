# Decision Matrix

A decision matrix is a structured approach to evaluating options against weighted criteria. It turns complex decisions into transparent, defensible choices.

## When to Use It

Use a decision matrix when:
- You have multiple viable options
- Multiple criteria matter
- Stakeholders have different priorities
- You need to document the rationale
- The decision is high-stakes or irreversible

Don't use it when:
- There's an obvious choice
- Speed matters more than optimization
- You're using it to justify a decision you've already made

## The Framework

### Step 1: Define Options

List all viable options. Include "do nothing" if it's a real option. Exclude options that fail hard constraints.

**Good options are:**
- Mutually exclusive (you can't do both)
- Collectively exhaustive (you've covered the space)
- Concrete (you know what implementation looks like)

### Step 2: Define Criteria

What factors matter for this decision? Criteria should be:

- **Independent:** Each criterion measures something different
- **Measurable:** You can evaluate options against them
- **Relevant:** They actually affect the outcome you care about
- **Accepted:** Stakeholders agree these are the right criteria

**Common criteria categories:**
- Cost (upfront, ongoing, hidden)
- Risk (likelihood, impact, reversibility)
- Time (to implement, to realize value)
- Capability (what it enables)
- Alignment (with strategy, culture, constraints)

### Step 3: Weight Criteria

Not all criteria matter equally. Assign weights that sum to 100%.

**Weighting methods:**
- **Direct assignment:** Stakeholders agree on percentages
- **Pairwise comparison:** Compare criteria two at a time
- **Point allocation:** Give each stakeholder 100 points to distribute

**The conversation about weights is often more valuable than the weights themselves.** It forces stakeholders to articulate what really matters.

### Step 4: Score Options

Rate each option against each criterion. Use a consistent scale (1-5 or 1-10).

**Scoring guidelines:**
- Define what each score means before you start
- Score one criterion at a time (not one option at a time)
- Use evidence where available
- Note assumptions and uncertainties

### Step 5: Calculate and Analyze

Multiply each score by its weight and sum across criteria.

**But don't stop at the number.** Analyze:
- How sensitive is the result to weight changes?
- Where are the biggest score differences?
- What assumptions drive the scores?
- Does the result match intuition? If not, why?

## Example

**Decision:** Which project management tool to adopt?

| Criterion | Weight | Tool A | Tool B | Tool C |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Ease of use | 30% | 4 | 5 | 3 |
| Integration | 25% | 5 | 3 | 4 |
| Cost | 20% | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| Scalability | 15% | 4 | 3 | 4 |
| Support | 10% | 3 | 4 | 3 |
| **Weighted Score** | | **3.95** | **3.85** | **3.75** |

Tool A wins, but barely. The decision isn't clear-cut, which suggests this might warrant more investigation.

## Common Pitfalls

### Analysis Paralysis

The matrix is a tool for decision-making, not a substitute for it. At some point, you have enough information. Make the call.

### False Precision

A score of 3.82 is not meaningfully different from 3.79. Don't let decimal places create false confidence.

### Gaming the Weights

If you change the weights until your preferred option wins, you're not using a decision matrix. You're rationalizing.

### Ignoring Intuition

If the matrix says Option A but your gut screams Option B, investigate. Your intuition might be detecting something the matrix missed.

### Forgetting Implementation

The best option on paper is worthless if you can't implement it. Include implementation feasibility in your criteria.

## Variations

### Threshold Matrix

Add a minimum acceptable score for each criterion. Options that fail any threshold are eliminated regardless of total score.

### Risk-Adjusted Matrix

Score both expected outcome and worst-case outcome. Weight them based on risk tolerance.

### Multi-Stakeholder Matrix

Let different stakeholders assign their own weights. Analyze where they agree and disagree.
