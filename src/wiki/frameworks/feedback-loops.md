# Feedback Loop Analysis

Feedback loops are circular chains of cause and effect where the output of a system influences its own input. Understanding them is essential for diagnosing persistent problems and designing effective interventions.

## The Basics

### What is a Feedback Loop?

A → B → C → A

The output (C) influences the input (A), which changes B, which changes C, which changes A again. The cycle continues.

### Two Types of Loops

**Reinforcing loops** amplify change. They make things grow or decline exponentially.

- Success breeds success
- Debt creates more debt
- Panic causes more panic
- Growth enables more growth

**Balancing loops** resist change. They stabilize systems around a target.

- Thermostat maintains temperature
- Hunger prompts eating
- Inventory triggers reordering
- Fatigue forces rest

## Why Loops Matter for Diagnosis

### Persistent Problems

If a problem keeps coming back despite interventions, look for a reinforcing loop that's working against you.

**Example:** High turnover
- Turnover increases workload on remaining staff
- Increased workload leads to burnout
- Burnout leads to more turnover

Breaking this loop requires intervention at multiple points, not just hiring faster.

### Unexpected Resistance

If a change doesn't stick, look for a balancing loop that's resisting it.

**Example:** Process improvement
- New process is introduced
- Extra effort required to follow new process
- Under deadline pressure, people revert to old habits
- System returns to previous state

The balancing loop around "minimize effort under pressure" defeats the change.

### Delayed Effects

Loops often have delays. Today's cause produces tomorrow's effect, making the connection hard to see.

**Example:** Quality investment
- Invest in quality → improved products (6-month delay)
- Improved products → higher customer satisfaction (3-month delay)
- Higher satisfaction → more referrals (6-month delay)
- More referrals → higher revenue (3-month delay)
- Higher revenue → more investment capacity

Total loop time: 18 months. In the meantime, the investment looks like pure cost.

## Analysis Process

### Step 1: Map the Variables

Identify all the factors involved in the system. Don't worry about connections yet.

### Step 2: Trace the Connections

For each variable, ask: "What does this directly influence?"

Draw arrows from cause to effect. Label each arrow:
- **+** if an increase in the cause leads to an increase in the effect
- **-** if an increase in the cause leads to a decrease in the effect

### Step 3: Identify Loops

Follow the arrows around. When you return to a starting point, you've found a loop.

**Determine loop type:**
- Count the negative (-) arrows in the loop
- Even number (including zero) = Reinforcing loop
- Odd number = Balancing loop

### Step 4: Find Delays

For each connection, estimate the delay. Significant delays change how the loop behaves and how interventions should be designed.

### Step 5: Identify Leverage Points

Where in the loop can you intervene?

**High leverage points:**
- Where you can break a reinforcing loop that's causing harm
- Where you can strengthen a balancing loop that's maintaining dysfunction
- Where you can change the direction of an arrow

## Intervention Strategies

### Breaking Reinforcing Loops

You don't need to break every link. Find the weakest point and intervene there.

**Example:** For the turnover loop, possible interventions:
- Reduce workload impact (cross-training)
- Increase burnout resilience (support programs)
- Speed up replacement (hiring pipeline)
- Change the base state (proactive staffing)

### Modifying Balancing Loops

To enable change, you need to shift what the loop is balancing toward.

**Example:** For the process adoption loop, possible interventions:
- Change the target (make new process the expected default)
- Reduce resistance (make new process easier)
- Add accountability (create cost for reverting)
- Allow the transition (temporary performance dip expected)

### Adding New Loops

Sometimes the solution is to create a new loop that counteracts the problematic one.

## Common Patterns

### The Fixes That Fail

- Problem occurs
- Quick fix applied
- Symptoms subside
- Root cause unaddressed
- Problem returns, often worse

The quick fix creates a balancing loop that masks the problem without solving it.

### Shifting the Burden

- Problem occurs
- Symptomatic solution applied
- Side effect undermines fundamental solution
- Dependency on symptomatic solution grows
- Capability for fundamental solution atrophies

**Example:** Outsourcing expertise instead of building it internally.

### Eroding Goals

- Performance falls short of goal
- Pressure to close the gap
- Goal is lowered instead of performance raised
- New goal becomes the standard
- Repeat

The balancing loop works, but toward the wrong target.
