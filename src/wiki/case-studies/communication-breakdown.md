# Case Study: The Communication Breakdown

**Industry:** Professional Services
**Problem Type:** Organizational
**Duration:** 4 weeks
**Outcome:** Project delivery time reduced 35%

---

## The Situation

A professional services firm was bleeding. Projects consistently ran over budget and past deadline. Client satisfaction was declining. Key employees were burning out and leaving.

**What we heard initially:**
- "Our project managers need better tools"
- "The teams aren't communicating"
- "We've grown too fast"

## The Investigation

### Week 1: Stakeholder Mapping

We interviewed:
- 8 project managers
- 12 practitioners (consultants, analysts)
- 4 partners
- 3 clients (with permission)

Each interview focused on: What works? What doesn't? Where does information get stuck?

### Week 2: Process Observation

We shadowed two active projects. Sat in meetings. Watched handoffs. Tracked information flow.

**Key observation:** Information moved vertically (up to partners, down to teams) but not horizontally (between teams, between projects).

A question from one team that could be answered by another team instead went up to a partner, then came back down. Two-day round trip for a five-minute conversation.

### Week 3: Root Cause Analysis

**Symptom:** Projects running late
**Direct cause:** Rework and waiting
**Why rework?:** Misunderstood requirements
**Why misunderstood?:** Incomplete handoffs
**Why incomplete?:** No handoff protocol
**Why no protocol?:** "Partners just knew"

**Symptom:** Budget overruns
**Direct cause:** Scope changes mid-project
**Why scope changes?:** Client expectations unclear
**Why unclear?:** Proposal-to-kickoff gap
**Why gap?:** Partners sold, different team delivered

**The Pattern:** The firm had grown from 15 to 80 people in three years. What worked with 15 people (informal coordination, partner omniscience) broke at 80. The communication infrastructure never scaled.

### Week 4: Structural Analysis

We mapped the actual communication network versus the org chart. See [Field Note: The Map Is Not The Territory](/wiki/field-notes/001-map-territory.html).

The org chart showed clear reporting lines. Reality showed:
- Partners as information bottlenecks
- Senior practitioners bypassing managers
- No horizontal connections between teams
- Critical knowledge in email, not shared systems

## The Findings

**Root cause:** Communication infrastructure didn't scale with organization size.

**Specifically:**
1. **No structured handoffs:** Knowledge transfer between phases was informal
2. **Partner bottleneck:** All decisions funneled through partners
3. **Siloed teams:** No mechanisms for cross-team learning
4. **Documentation gaps:** Project knowledge lived in individuals

## The Recommendations

### Immediate (Week 1-2)

1. **Structured kickoff protocol**
   - Mandatory 90-minute kickoff meeting
   - Defined attendees: selling partner, delivery lead, full team
   - Standard agenda covering scope, constraints, success criteria
   - Written summary distributed same day

2. **Decision delegation matrix**
   - Document which decisions require partner approval
   - Everything else delegated to project managers
   - Published and enforced

### Short-term (Month 1-2)

3. **Project retrospectives**
   - Mandatory 60-minute debrief at project close
   - What worked, what didn't, what to do differently
   - Lessons documented in searchable repository

4. **Cross-team standups**
   - Weekly 15-minute all-hands standup
   - Each team: what they're working on, what's blocking them
   - Creates horizontal visibility

### Medium-term (Month 2-4)

5. **Knowledge management system**
   - Central repository for project artifacts
   - Searchable lessons learned
   - Templates and playbooks

6. **Communication training**
   - For project managers: facilitation, escalation, handoffs
   - For practitioners: documentation, status reporting

## The Implementation

The firm implemented recommendations 1-4 immediately. Recommendation 5 was in progress at engagement end. Recommendation 6 was scheduled for the following quarter.

## The Outcome

**After 6 months:**
- On-time delivery: 58% → 82%
- Budget accuracy: +/- 30% → +/- 12%
- Client satisfaction (NPS): +15 points
- Employee turnover: Declined 40%

**Qualitative changes:**
- Partners reported feeling "less essential to every decision"
- Project managers reported "actually being able to manage"
- Practitioners reported "knowing what I'm walking into"

## Key Lessons

### Informal works until it doesn't

What works at 15 people breaks at 80. The point of breakdown isn't predictable, but it's inevitable.

### Bottlenecks aren't always machines

The partners were human bottlenecks. They meant well. They were trying to help. But they were also the constraint.

### Communication is infrastructure

It requires design, investment, and maintenance just like any other system.

### The problem you're told isn't the problem

"We need better tools" was a symptom. The root cause was organizational design that hadn't evolved.

*Growing is easy. Scaling is hard. The difference is infrastructure.*
