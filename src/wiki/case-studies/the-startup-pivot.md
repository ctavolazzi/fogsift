# Case Study: The Startup That Wouldn't Pivot

**Sector:** SaaS / B2B
**Duration:** 8 months of observation
**Outcome:** Eventual pivot, 14 months later than it should have been

---

## The Situation

A 6-person SaaS startup had built a project management tool for construction companies. They'd spent 14 months building it. The product was polished. The team was talented. The pitch was sharp.

One problem: nobody was buying it.

In 8 months of sales effort, they had closed 3 paying customers. Customer acquisition cost: approximately $40,000 per customer (including time). Monthly revenue per customer: $200.

The math didn't work. Everyone could see it. Nobody would say it.

## The Problem

### Surface Level
"We need better marketing" was the team's diagnosis. They hired a marketing consultant. They redesigned the landing page. They ran LinkedIn ads. They attended construction industry trade shows.

Nothing changed. The 3 customers weren't growing into 30.

### Deeper Level
The real issue wasn't marketing. It was product-market fit. Construction companies managed projects with spreadsheets, whiteboards, and phone calls. They didn't *want* a SaaS tool. The problem the startup was solving wasn't a problem the market felt urgently enough to pay for.

Signs that were visible from the start:
- **Long sales cycles** (3+ months) — customers weren't eager
- **Heavy customization requests** — the product didn't fit their workflow
- **Low engagement** — paying customers logged in twice a month
- **No referrals** — happy customers refer. These customers didn't.

### Root Level
The founders had fallen into three traps simultaneously:

1. **[Sunk cost](/wiki/field-notes/008-sunk-cost-trap.html):** "We've spent 14 months building this. We can't throw it away."
2. **[Survivorship bias](/wiki/concepts/survivorship-bias.html):** "Procore is worth $10B, so the market clearly wants construction software."
3. **[Confirmation bias](/wiki/concepts/cognitive-biases.html):** Every small positive signal was amplified. Every negative signal was explained away.

## The Diagnosis

When we sat down with the team, we ran through three exercises:

### 1. Assumption Mapping

We listed every assumption behind the business:

| Assumption | Evidence | Status |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Construction companies want to digitize PM | 3 customers in 8 months | **Weak** |
| They'll pay $200/month | 3 paying, but low engagement | **Weak** |
| We can acquire customers at scale | $40K CAC, no scalable channel found | **Failed** |
| Word of mouth will drive growth | Zero referrals in 8 months | **Failed** |
| Our product is better than alternatives | Customers request heavy customization | **Questionable** |

Two critical assumptions had failed. One was questionable. The business model was built on sand.

### 2. Clean Slate Test

"If you were starting today, with everything you know now, would you build this exact product for this exact market?"

Long silence. Then: "No."

### 3. Strength Inventory

What had the team actually built that was valuable?

- A sophisticated scheduling engine
- Real-time collaboration features
- A mobile-first field reporting tool
- Deep expertise in complex project management

These assets were valuable. Just not for this market.

## The Pivot

The team eventually pivoted to event production management — a market where:
- Projects are time-critical (urgency to adopt tools)
- Teams are distributed (collaboration features matter)
- Scheduling is complex (their engine's strength)
- Budget is available (event companies spend on tools)

The pivot used 60% of the existing codebase. But it required a complete rethinking of the user experience, pricing, and go-to-market strategy.

## The Timeline Problem

The pivot happened at month 22. It should have happened at month 8.

What consumed those 14 months:
- Months 8-12: "Let's try better marketing" (no improvement)
- Months 12-16: "Let's try a different sales approach" (marginal improvement)
- Months 16-20: "Let's try a freemium model" (increased signups, no conversions)
- Months 20-22: "Okay, the market isn't working" (finally honest)

Each failed experiment consumed 4 months. If the team had set pre-committed kill criteria ("If we don't reach 20 paying customers by month 10, we pivot"), they would have saved a year and $200,000+ in burn.

## Lessons

1. **Product-market fit is not optional.** No amount of marketing, sales tactics, or feature development compensates for a market that doesn't want what you're selling.

2. **Set kill criteria early.** Define the conditions for pivoting before you're emotionally invested in the current direction.

3. **Listen to what customers DO, not what they SAY.** The 3 customers said the product was "great." They logged in twice a month. Behavior is the only honest signal.

4. **Your assets are portable.** The technology, skills, and knowledge you build are valuable even if the current application isn't. Pivoting isn't starting over — it's redirecting.

5. **Speed of learning > speed of building.** The team spent 14 months building before testing their core assumption. They could have tested it in 14 days with a prototype and 20 customer interviews.
