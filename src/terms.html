                For FogSift's "Move the Needle" Queue Offer
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="wiki-content" style="max-width: 65ch; margin: 0 auto;">

            <h2>1. What This Is</h2>
            <p>Your $20 payment holds a spot in the queue. That's it.</p>
            <p>This is <strong>not</strong> a work contract, consulting agreement, or promise of specific deliverables. It's a payment to reserve time and attention from FogSift until we can get to your request.</p>
            <p>We're a small operation trying to monetize a YouTube channel by helping people with DIY projects and problem-solving. We're figuring this out as we go, and we appreciate your patience.</p>

            <h2>2. What You Might Get</h2>
            <p>If and when we address your request, you may receive some combination of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A PDF report with our findings</li>
                <li>A short video response (usually 15-90 seconds)</li>
                <li>Possibly a longer YouTube video, at our discretion</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>None of this is guaranteed.</strong> We reserve the right to decline any request for any reason, and we'll issue a refund if we do.</p>

            <h2>3. Don't Submit</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Anything illegal or unethical</li>
                <li>Financial advice questions, investment decisions, or securities stuff</li>
                <li>Requests targeting specific people, personal disputes, harassment, or doxxing</li>
                <li>Confidential info you don't have permission to share</li>
                <li>Anything you don't own or have rights to</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>When in doubt, don't submit it.</strong></p>

            <h2>4. No Guarantees</h2>
            <p>We cannot guarantee:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>When</strong> we'll get to your request (could be days, could be weeks)</li>
                <li><strong>What</strong> the outcome will be</li>
                <li><strong>That</strong> your data is 100% secure (we do our best, but the internet is the internet)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Submit at your own risk. Don't send anything you'd panic about if it leaked.</p>

            <h2>5. Our Capacity</h2>
            <p>We <em>try</em> to address up to 2 requests per day. Some days that happens, some days it doesn't. Life, health, and sanity come first.</p>
            <p>We won't take on more than we can handle. We'd rather do fewer things well than many things poorly.</p>

            <h2>6. Refunds</h2>
            <p>Request a refund through Ko-fi if:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We haven't addressed your request yet</li>
                <li>You changed your mind</li>
                <li>Any reason, really</li>
            </ul>
            <p>No hard feelings. We'd rather you ask for your money back than feel stuck.</p>

            <h2>7. Age Requirement</h2>
            <p>You must be <strong>18 or older</strong> to participate.</p>
            <p>If you're under 18, a parent or guardian must submit the request on your behalf, with their payment method, and their active involvement. We're not set up to work directly with minors.</p>

            <h2>8. Content & Your Submission</h2>
            <p>What we know:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We might turn your request into YouTube content</li>
                <li>If you want privacy, tell us clearly in your submission</li>
                <li>We'll do our best to respect your wishes, but we can't guarantee anything submitted online stays private</li>
                <li>We're not trying to steal anyone's ideas or content</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We're learning as we go. If something feels off, talk to us.</p>

            <h2>9. We're Not Liable</h2>
            <p>FogSift is not responsible for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Decisions you make based on our response</li>
                <li>Things outside our control (security breaches, platform issues, etc.)</li>
                <li>Your expectations not matching reality</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is experimental. We're doing our best.</p>

            <h2>10. This Can Change</h2>
            <p>These terms might change as we learn what works. The price might change too (probably up eventually, if we're being honest).</p>
            <p>By participating, you're agreeing to the terms as they exist when you submit.</p>
